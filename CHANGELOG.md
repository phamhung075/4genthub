### Fixed
- **üêõ Fixed Global Context Display Issue in Frontend** - 2025-09-08
  - **Issue**: Global context was not displaying correctly in the frontend despite being successfully created/updated via MCP tools
  - **Root Cause**: Backend's `_to_entity` method in `global_context_repository.py` was not properly mapping the nested structure (schema v2.0) to the flat structure expected by the frontend
  - **Solution**: Updated the `_to_entity` method to properly convert nested structure to frontend-compatible flat structure
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Modified `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/global_context_repository.py`
    - Added proper mapping from nested structure fields (organization, development, security, etc.) to flat frontend fields (user_preferences, ai_agent_settings, etc.)
    - Preserved both nested and flat structures for backward compatibility
  - **Frontend Expected Structure**:
    - Flat fields: user_preferences, ai_agent_settings, workflow_preferences, development_tools, security_settings, etc.
    - Also includes nested structure: organization, development, security, operations, preferences
  - **Impact**: Global context now displays correctly in frontend with all data properly mapped and visible
  - **Testing**: Verified data is stored correctly in PostgreSQL database and retrieved properly through API
