  - Test suites for environment loading, session management, and state persistence
  - Files: `test_runner.py`, `run_tests_enhanced.sh`, `.github/workflows/test_coverage.yml`

- **Hook Configuration Factory Pattern**: Centralized YAML-based configuration system
  - Created `utils/config_factory.py` with caching and fallback mechanisms
  - 10 comprehensive YAML configuration files for all hook messages and settings
  - Backward compatible with deprecation warnings for legacy imports
  - Files: `config_factory.py`, `error_messages.yaml`, `system_config.yaml`, etc.

  - Tool/action mappings with validation hints and post-action guidance
  - Factory pattern with YAML configuration for maintainability
  - Files: `mcp_hint_matrix.py`, `mcp_hint_matrix_factory.py`, `mcp_hint_matrix_config.yaml`

- **Production Deployment Infrastructure** (Phase 6 Complete):
  - Deployment manager with production, development, and database-only modes
  - Real-time health monitoring with performance metrics and alerting
  - Legacy cleanup tool with safe backup and restoration procedures
  - Files: `deployment-manager.sh`, `health-monitor.sh`, `cleanup-legacy.sh`

- **Status Line v4**: Real-time MCP connection monitoring with intelligent caching
  - Live connection status with response times and error states
  - Project name and git branch display with color coding
