### Fixed
- **🖱️ Action Button Double-Click Issue** - 2025-09-07
  - Fixed critical UX issue where action buttons (View Details, Edit, etc.) required two clicks to open dialogs on fresh page load
  - Root cause: async data loading was blocking dialog state changes in LazyTaskList and LazySubtaskList components

  - Dialogs now open instantly on first click and show loading states while data loads in background
  - Files modified:
    - `dhafnck-frontend/src/components/LazyTaskList.tsx` - Fixed openDialog function to set state before async loading
    - `dhafnck-frontend/src/components/LazySubtaskList.tsx` - Fixed handleSubtaskAction function for immediate dialog opening

  - Better space utilization for viewing detailed task and subtask information
  - All detail dialogs now have the same professional appearance and sizing

  - Updated `Subtask.update_status()` method to automatically set `progress_percentage = 100` when status changes to 'done'  
  - Updated `Subtask.update_status()` method to reset `progress_percentage = 0` when status changes to 'todo' from completed state
  - Updated MCP `complete_subtask` handler to include `progress_percentage = 100` in completion data

- **🔧 LazySubtaskList Critical Syntax & Display Issues** - 2025-09-07
  - Fixed critical try-catch block syntax error that was causing frontend crashes around line 179
  - Fixed `getSubtask()` function to use dedicated `/api/v2/subtasks/{subtask_id}` endpoint instead of filtering list results  
  - Fixed `deleteSubtask()` function signature to use correct parameter (only `subtask_id`, not `task_id, subtask_id`)
  - Updated `Subtask` interface to include missing fields (`progress_percentage`, `progress_notes`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at`)
  - "View details" button now correctly displays subtask information instead of showing "nothing"
