## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **🎨 Dialog Size Consistency Update** - 2025-09-07
  - Updated TaskDetailsDialog and SubtaskDetailsDialog to match the larger size of BranchDetailsDialog and ProjectDetailsDialog
  - Changed dialog width from `max-w-4xl` to `w-[90vw] max-w-6xl h-[85vh]` for consistent user experience
  - Added proper flex layout structure with `overflow-hidden` and proper content scrolling
  - Enhanced dialog styling with consistent background colors and shadow effects  
  - Better space utilization for viewing detailed task and subtask information
  - All detail dialogs now have the same professional appearance and sizing
  - Files modified:
    - `dhafnck-frontend/src/components/TaskDetailsDialog.tsx` - Updated dialog size and layout structure
    - `dhafnck-frontend/src/components/SubtaskDetailsDialog.tsx` - Updated dialog size and content padding
- **🔧 Subtask JSON View Button Consolidation** - 2025-09-07
  - Removed duplicate JSON button from subtask row actions in LazySubtaskList
  - Consolidated JSON view functionality in SubtaskDetailsDialog using proper tab interface
  - Fixed RawJSONDisplay prop mismatch (`data` vs `jsonData`) that was causing crashes
  - Enhanced JSON display in dialog with proper title and filename for subtasks  
  - JSON view is now only accessible through the details dialog, providing a cleaner and more consistent UI
  - Files modified:
    - `dhafnck-frontend/src/components/LazySubtaskList.tsx` - Removed JSON button and inline display
    - `dhafnck-frontend/src/components/SubtaskDetailsDialog.tsx` - Fixed RawJSONDisplay props
- **🔧 Subtask Completion Progress Percentage Auto-Setting** - 2025-09-07
  - Fixed issue where `progress_percentage` was not automatically set to 100% when subtasks were completed
  - Updated `Subtask.complete()` method to automatically set `progress_percentage = 100`
  - Updated `Subtask.update_status()` method to automatically set `progress_percentage = 100` when status changes to 'done'  
  - Updated `Subtask.update_status()` method to reset `progress_percentage = 0` when status changes to 'todo' from completed state
  - Updated MCP `complete_subtask` handler to include `progress_percentage = 100` in completion data
  - Ensures consistent behavior across all completion methods (MCP, API, direct domain calls)
  - Backend now handles this automatically without relying on frontend to send correct values
  - Files modified:
    - `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/domain/entities/subtask.py`
    - `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/mcp_controllers/subtask_mcp_controller/handlers/crud_handler.py`

- **🔧 LazySubtaskList Critical Syntax & Display Issues** - 2025-09-07
  - Fixed critical try-catch block syntax error that was causing frontend crashes around line 179
  - Fixed `getSubtask()` function to use dedicated `/api/v2/subtasks/{subtask_id}` endpoint instead of filtering list results  
  - Fixed `deleteSubtask()` function signature to use correct parameter (only `subtask_id`, not `task_id, subtask_id`)
  - Updated `Subtask` interface to include missing fields (`progress_percentage`, `progress_notes`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at`)
  - "View details" button now correctly displays subtask information instead of showing "nothing"
  - All detailed fields (description, progress notes, assignees) now display properly in SubtaskDetailsDialog
  - Updated test cases to match corrected API signatures
  - **Added Raw JSON Display**: Implemented consistent JSON view functionality for subtasks like other components
  - Added new JSON button in subtask actions with expandable Raw JSON display using RawJSONDisplay component
  - JSON data displays in expandable table rows with copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Consistent with BranchDetailsDialog and SubtaskDetailsDialog JSON display patterns
