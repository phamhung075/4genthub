### Fixed
- **Session 38 - Iteration 27 (2025-09-17)**: Fixed Hook System Comprehensive Tests
  - **Issue**: `test_hook_system_comprehensive.py` had multiple failing tests due to import and fixture issues
  - **Root Causes**:
    1. Import patches targeting wrong modules (pre_tool_use instead of utils modules)
    2. Non-existent fixtures (temp_dir, mock_log_dir)
    3. References to non-existent functions (get_pending_hints, analyze_and_hint)
  - **Solutions Applied**:
    1. Updated all import patches to correct module paths:
       - `utils.session_tracker.is_file_in_session`
       - `utils.docs_indexer.check_documentation_requirement`
       - `utils.role_enforcer.check_tool_permission`
       - `utils.context_injector.inject_context_sync`

  - **Root Causes**:
    1. Test mode auto-detection: ContextInjectionConfig was detecting pytest and disabling MCP requests
    2. Obsolete API patches: Tests were patching deprecated function-based API instead of class-based
  - **Solutions Applied**:
    1. Added manual test mode override: `config.test_mode = False` after initialization
    2. Updated patches from `format_session_context` to `SessionContextFormatter.format`
  - **Fixed Tests**:
    - `test_extract_agent_mappings`: Fixed with test mode override
    - `test_inject_context_simple`: Fixed with test mode override

  - **Solution Applied**: Updated tests to match current implementation per golden rule
  - **Fixed Tests**:
    - TestFormatMCPContext class: All 5 test methods now passing
      - Changed from expecting formatted strings with emojis to JSON output
      - Fixed function call signature from 3 params to 1 dict param
    - TestLoadDevelopmentContext: Fixed 2 test methods
