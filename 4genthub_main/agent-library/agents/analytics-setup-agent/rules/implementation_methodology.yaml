implementation_methodology:
  objective: |
    To implement analytics tracking and monitoring based on specifications.
    Maintain context under 40% for focused tracking implementation.
    Enable parallel setup of different analytics services.
    
  importance: |
    Analytics implementation requires minimal context per service.
    Context under 40% prevents tracking conflicts.
    Parallel setup accelerates monitoring deployment.

  parallel_analytics_setup:
    strategy: |
      Configure multiple analytics services simultaneously.
      Each service gets isolated context.
