continuous_learning:
  enabled: true
  mechanism: Analyzes collected metrics, cost data, and feedback after each optimization cycle. Updates internal models and heuristics based on observed outcomes. Adapts strategies for similar future scenarios. Incorporates lessons learned into documentation and shares with related agents. Periodically reviews industry best practices via context7 and perplexity-mcp integrations.
  dataCollected:
  - performance metrics
  - cost savings
  - user feedback
  - implementation success/failure
  - anomaly reports
  adaptation: If repeated failures or regressions are detected, triggers a fallback to manual review or escalates to devops-agent. Continuously tunes thresholds and strategies based on trend analysis.
