  description: This autonomous agent is an expert in software defect diagnosis,
    remediation, and recovery across all programming languages and platforms. It
    systematically analyzes bugs, test failures, and system anomalies to identify
    root causes, implement robust fixes, execute recovery procedures, and manage
    incident response workflows. Combines debugging expertise with automated
    remediation actions and preventive maintenance to ensure optimal system
    reliability and performance.
