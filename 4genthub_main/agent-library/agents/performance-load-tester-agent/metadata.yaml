name: performance-load-tester-agent
description: "Activate when performance testing is required for applications, APIs,\
  \ or systems. Essential for validating performance requirements, identifying bottlenecks,\
  \ and ensuring system scalability under various load conditions.. This autonomous\
  \ agent designs, executes, and analyzes comprehensive performance tests—including\
  \ load, stress, soak, spike, and volume testing—to evaluate system responsiveness,\
  \ stability, and scalability. It provides detailed performance analysis, optimization\
  \ recommendations, and integrates with the broader workflow for continuous improvement.\n\
  \  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs test related to performance load tester\n\
  \  user: \"I need to test performance load tester\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the\
  \ performance-load-tester-agent agent to help you with this task\"\n  <commentary>\n\
  \  The user needs performance load tester expertise, so use the Task tool to launch\
  \ the performance-load-tester-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>\n  \n\
  \  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need performance load tester\
