# Task Context Completion Summary Storage Fixes

## Issue Summary
The Task Context button in the frontend was not displaying any context data because the `completion_summary` field was not being properly stored when tasks were completed. This was due to multiple underlying issues in the backend code.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Repository Primary Key Issues
Multiple context repositories were missing proper primary key assignments when creating entities, causing SQLAlchemy to throw "NULL identity key" errors.

### 2. BranchContext Field Mismatch
The BranchContextRepository was trying to access non-existent fields (`force_local_only` and `inheritance_disabled`) on the BranchContext entity.

### 3. Logger Scope Conflict
A critical UnboundLocalError was occurring in the task.py file due to a local logger variable being created inside an if block, causing Python to treat the logger as local throughout the function scope.

### 4. Database Authentication Issue (Pending)
The task repository factory is falling back to mock repository instead of ORM repository due to PostgreSQL authentication failures.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: ProjectContextRepository Primary Key
**File:** `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/project_context_repository.py`
**Line:** 75

**Before:**
```python
db_model = ProjectContextModel(
    project_id=entity.id,
    # ... other fields
)
```

**After:**
```python
db_model = ProjectContextModel(
    id=entity.id,  # Added primary key
    project_id=entity.id,
    # ... other fields
)
```

### Fix 2: BranchContextRepository Primary Key
**File:** `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/branch_context_repository.py`
**Line:** 87

**Before:**
```python
db_model = BranchContextModel(
    id=str(uuid.uuid4()),  # Generated new UUID instead of using entity.id
    branch_id=entity.id,
    # ... other fields
)
```

**After:**
```python
db_model = BranchContextModel(
    id=entity.id,  # Use entity.id as the primary key
    branch_id=entity.id,
    # ... other fields
)
```

### Fix 3: TaskContextRepository Primary Key
**File:** `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/task_context_repository.py`
**Line:** 65

**Before:**
```python
db_model = TaskContextModel(
    task_id=entity.id,
    # ... other fields
)
```

**After:**
```python
db_model = TaskContextModel(
    id=entity.id,  # Added primary key
    task_id=entity.id,
    # ... other fields
)
```

### Fix 4: Remove Non-Existent Fields from BranchContext
**File:** `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/branch_context_repository.py`
**Lines:** 217-218 (removed)

**Before:**
```python
'force_local_only': db_model.force_local_only or False,
'inheritance_disabled': db_model.inheritance_disabled or False,
```

**After:**
These lines were removed as the fields don't exist in the BranchContext model.

### Fix 5: Logger Scope Issue in Task Entity
**File:** `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/domain/entities/task.py`
**Lines:** 667-668

**Before:**
```python
if self.context_id is None:
    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # This created a local variable!
    logger.warning(...)
```

**After:**
```python
if self.context_id is None:
    logger.warning(...)  # Now uses module-level logger
```

## Testing Results

### Successful Tests
1. ✅ Repository primary key issues resolved
2. ✅ BranchContext field access errors fixed
3. ✅ Logger scope conflict resolved
4. ✅ Docker containers rebuilt successfully

### Pending Issues
1. ⚠️ Database authentication preventing ORM repository usage
2. ⚠️ System falling back to mock repository which uses "task-1" format instead of UUIDs
3. ⚠️ Full end-to-end testing blocked by database connection issues

## Impact Analysis

### What's Fixed
- Context creation no longer fails with "NULL identity key" errors
- BranchContext operations work without field access errors
- Task completion doesn't encounter UnboundLocalError

### What Remains
- Database authentication needs to be fixed for proper ORM repository usage
- Mock repository generates invalid task IDs ("task-1" instead of UUIDs)
- Full validation of completion_summary storage pending database fix

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Authentication**
   - Review Docker environment variables
   - Ensure PostgreSQL credentials match application configuration
   - Verify database initialization scripts

2. **Validate ORM Repository**
   - Confirm task creation uses UUID format
   - Test completion_summary storage
   - Verify context retrieval through Task Context button

3. **Frontend Integration Testing**
   - Create tasks through UI
   - Complete tasks with summaries
   - Verify context display in TaskDetailsDialog

## Code Quality Improvements

### Recommendations
1. Add database connection health checks at startup
2. Implement better fallback mechanisms for repository creation
3. Add comprehensive logging for context operations
4. Consider adding integration tests for the complete flow

### Technical Debt
1. Mock repository should generate valid UUIDs
2. Repository factory needs better error handling
3. Database configuration should validate credentials early

## Conclusion

Multiple critical issues were identified and fixed in the context storage system. The primary issues related to missing primary keys and field mismatches have been resolved. However, the database authentication issue prevents full validation of the fixes. Once the database connection is restored, the system should properly store and retrieve completion summaries through the Task Context button.
