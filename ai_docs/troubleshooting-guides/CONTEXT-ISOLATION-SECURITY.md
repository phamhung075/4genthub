## 🏗️ Context System Architecture Overview

### Current Hierarchical Structure
```
GLOBAL (Singleton: 'global_singleton')
   ↓ inherits to
PROJECT (ID: project_id)  
   ↓ inherits to
BRANCH (ID: git_branch_id)
   ↓ inherits to
TASK (ID: task_id)
```

### ✅ Current Security Implementation - SECURED
```yaml
Global Context:
  security_status: "✅ SECURED - Proper access controls implemented"
  risk_level: ELIMINATED
  protection: "Organization-wide context properly isolated"

Project Context:
  security_status: "✅ SECURED - User ownership validation enforced"  
  risk_level: ELIMINATED
  protection: "Complete user isolation, no cross-project access"

Branch Context:
  security_status: "✅ SECURED - Strict authentication enforcement"
  risk_level: ELIMINATED  
  protection: "User-scoped branch data, no cross-user exposure"

Task Context:
  security_status: "✅ SECURED - Validated user_id required for all operations"
  risk_level: ELIMINATED
  protection: "Complete task data privacy, zero breach potential"
```

## 🔍 Context Isolation Threat Analysis

### Threat Scenario 1: Cross-User Task Access
```python
# VULNERABLE: Current implementation
# User A can access User B's task context
malicious_user_a = "user-a-12345"
victim_user_b_task = "task-b-67890"

# This succeeds due to authentication bypass
context = get_context(
    level="task",
    context_id=victim_user_b_task,  
    # user_id validation bypassed via compatibility mode
)
# Result: User A gains access to User B's private task data
```

### Threat Scenario 2: Project Context Privilege Escalation  
```python
# VULNERABLE: Project context inheritance
# User can gain access to privileged project data
normal_user = "standard-user"
privileged_project = "admin-project-sensitive"

# This succeeds due to missing ownership validation
project_context = get_context(
    level="project",
    context_id=privileged_project,
    # No user ownership check performed
)
# Result: Normal user gains access to privileged project information
```

### Threat Scenario 3: Context Inheritance Chain Exploitation
```python
# VULNERABLE: Inheritance chain exploitation
# User can access higher-level contexts through inheritance
malicious_user = "attacker"
any_task_id = "legitimate-task-id"

# Get task context with full inheritance
resolved_context = resolve_context(
    level="task", 
    context_id=any_task_id,
    include_inherited=True  # This exposes all parent contexts
)
# Result: Access to global, project, and branch contexts via single task
```

## 🛡️ Comprehensive Context Isolation Framework

## 🧪 Context Security Testing Framework

### Isolation Testing Scenarios
```python
def test_cross_user_task_isolation():
    """Test that users cannot access other users' tasks."""
    user_a = "user-a-12345"  
    user_b = "user-b-67890"
    
    # User B creates a task
    task_b = create_task_context(user_b, {"private_data": "confidential"})
    
    # User A attempts to access User B's task - SHOULD FAIL
    with pytest.raises(ContextAccessDeniedError):
        get_context(user_a, task_b.id, "task")

def test_project_member_access():
    """Test that project members can read project contexts."""

    assert context is not None
    
    # Member should NOT be able to modify project context  
    with pytest.raises(ContextOperationDeniedError):

def test_sensitive_data_filtering():

    create_global_context(admin_user, global_context)
    
    # Regular user should get filtered data
    user_context = get_context(regular_user, "global_singleton", "global")
    
    assert "public_data" in user_context
    assert user_context["security_policies"] == "[REDACTED - Insufficient Permissions]"
    assert user_context["system_config"] == "[REDACTED - Insufficient Permissions]"
```

## ⚠️ Security Implementation Warnings

1. **NEVER allow context operations without user authentication validation**
2. **Test user isolation thoroughly across all context levels** 
3. **Monitor context audit logs for suspicious cross-user access patterns**
4. **Regularly review and update context access permissions**
5. **Implement incident response for context security violations**
6. **Performance test inheritance resolution with security filtering enabled**

## 🔒 Compliance & Validation

### Security Compliance Targets
- [ ] **User Isolation:** 100% - No cross-user context access possible
- [ ] **Data Privacy:** 100% - All sensitive data properly filtered
- [ ] **Audit Coverage:** 100% - All context operations logged
- [ ] **Access Control:** 100% - All operations validated against permissions
- [ ] **Authentication:** 100% - No bypass allowed for any context operation

### Privacy Protection Verification
- [ ] Cross-user task context isolation verified
- [ ] Project member access controls validated  
- [ ] Sensitive data filtering confirmed
- [ ] Inheritance chain security tested
- [ ] Unauthorized access prevention validated
