## Task Dependencies Map

```
Task 1 (JWT Auth) 
├── Task 2 (Registration API)
│   └── Task 4 (Password Reset)
├── Task 3 (Login/Logout)
└── Task 6 (Payment Integration)
    └── Task 7 (Payment Security Audit)

Task 5 (Auth Testing) depends on [Task 1, Task 2, Task 3]
```

## Priority Distribution

- **High Priority**: 6 tasks (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)
- **Medium Priority**: 1 task (Task 4)

## Agent Assignment Distribution

- **@coding-agent**: 5 tasks (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- **@security-auditor-agent**: 6 tasks (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)  
- **@test-orchestrator-agent**: 2 tasks (Tasks 5, 7)

## Estimated Timeline

**Total Effort**: 18 days  
- Branch 1 (Auth): 12 days
- Branch 2 (Payment): 6 days

**Critical Path**: Task 1 → Task 6 → Task 7 (9 days)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Authentication Foundation**: Task 1 (JWT) must be completed first as it's a dependency for most other tasks
2. **Parallel Development**: Tasks 2 and 3 can be developed in parallel after Task 1
3. **Security Focus**: Heavy emphasis on security with @security-auditor-agent assigned to 6/7 tasks
4. **Testing Integration**: Comprehensive testing planned with dedicated testing tasks
5. **Cross-Branch Dependencies**: Payment system depends on authentication (Task 6 depends on Task 1)

## Troubleshooting Notes

**Import Error Resolution**: The `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_task` tool is experiencing import issues with `fastmcp.task_management.interface.domain`. Based on previous investigation:

- All imports in the codebase are using correct paths
- TaskMCPController imports and initializes successfully  
- The error may be from cached files or previous environment state
- Manual task creation via alternative methods may be required

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve MCP Tool Issues**: Fix import error in task management module
2. **Create Tasks Manually**: Use alternative task creation methods if MCP tool remains problematic
3. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all task dependencies are properly established
4. **Begin Development**: Start with Task 1 (JWT Authentication Service) as the foundation
