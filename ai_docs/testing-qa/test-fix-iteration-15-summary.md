# Test Fix Iteration 15 Summary

## Date: September 24, 2025

## Overview
In iteration 15, I verified the test suite status and found that all tests that were initially reported as failing are now passing. The fixes from previous iterations (6-14) have been effective in stabilizing the test suite.

## Status Summary
- **Total Tests Tracked**: 372
- **Failed Tests**: 0 
- **Passed Test Files Cached**: 15
- **Cache Efficiency**: 15 test files will be skipped on future runs

## Tests Verified in This Iteration
1. **database_config_test.py** - 32/34 tests passing (2 skipped)
2. **agent_communication_hub_test.py** - 24/24 tests passing
3. **test_get_task.py** - 18/18 tests passing
4. **mcp_token_service_test.py** - 23/23 tests passing
5. **unified_context_facade_factory_test.py** - 19/19 tests passing
6. **test_project_application_service.py** - 25/25 tests passing

## Key Findings
- All tests that were reported as failing in the initial unit test run are now passing
- The test cache is working effectively to track passing tests
- No new test fixes were required in this iteration
- The systematic approach from previous iterations has successfully addressed all test issues

## Documentation Updated
- CHANGELOG.md - Added iteration 15 verification results
- TEST-CHANGELOG.md - Added session details for iteration 15
- Created this summary document

## Conclusion
The test suite is in a stable state with no failing tests found. The fixes applied in previous iterations continue to work correctly. The systematic approach of addressing root causes rather than symptoms has resulted in a robust test suite.
