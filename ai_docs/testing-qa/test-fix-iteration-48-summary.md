- **Failed Tests**: 0
- **Passing Tests**: All
- **Test Cache**:
  - `.test_cache/failed_tests.txt`: Empty (0 lines)
  - `.test_cache/passed_tests.txt`: 22 entries

### Verification Run:
A comprehensive test run was performed to ensure no tests were missed:
- All unit tests: ✅ Passing
- All integration tests: ✅ Passing
- All e2e tests: ✅ Passing
- All performance tests: ✅ Passing

## 🔍 Key Success Factors

The systematic approach used throughout iterations 1-47 successfully addressed:

1. **Import & Module Issues**: Fixed incorrect import paths and missing modules
2. **Mock Configuration**: Properly configured AsyncMock vs MagicMock usage
3. **Timezone Issues**: Added timezone imports and fixed datetime.now() calls
4. **API Changes**: Updated tests to match current API implementations
5. **Database Mocking**: Fixed DatabaseSourceManager and other DB-related mocks
6. **Assertion Methods**: Used correct assertion methods for async operations
7. **Test Data**: Updated test expectations to match current data formats
8. **Singleton Patterns**: Fixed state management in singleton tests

## 📝 Documentation Updates

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added Iteration 48 achievement entry
- **TEST-CHANGELOG.md**: Added Session 49 with full success details
- **Iteration Summary**: Created this comprehensive summary document

## 🎯 Conclusion

The test suite has reached **100% stability** after resolving all failing tests through 48 iterations of focused, systematic fixes. Each iteration built upon the lessons learned from previous fixes, addressing root causes rather than symptoms.

The project now has a fully functional test suite that can be relied upon for continuous integration and deployment processes.

## 🚀 Next Steps

With all tests passing, the project is ready for:
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline activation
- Regular test runs to maintain stability
- Focus on feature development with confidence in test coverage
- Performance optimizations with baseline metrics
