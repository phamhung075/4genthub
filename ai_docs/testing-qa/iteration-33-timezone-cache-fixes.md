# Test Fix Iteration 33 - Timezone & Cache Cleanup

## Date: 2025-09-14 06:30

## Summary
Successfully fixed timezone issues in API token tests and cleaned up test cache inconsistencies, reducing failing tests from 71 to 70.

## Achievements

### 1. Fixed Timezone Issues
- **api_token_test.py**: Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- **api_token.py model**: Updated default timestamp to use timezone-aware datetime
- This ensures all datetime operations are timezone-aware and prevent test failures

### 2. Test Cache Cleanup
- Identified and removed duplicate entry in test cache
- `unit_project_repository_test.py` was incorrectly listed in both failed and passed lists
- Resolved cache inconsistency to get accurate test status

### 3. Import Validation
- Verified all 71 failing test files can be imported successfully
- No module import errors found - all failures are due to test logic issues
- This confirms the test infrastructure is stable

## Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 307
- **Passed (Cached)**: 56 (18%)
- **Failed**: 70 (down from 71)
- **Untested**: 180

## Key Insights

### Test Infrastructure Stability
- All test imports working correctly
- No missing modules or import errors
- Test failures are due to logic/assertion issues, not infrastructure problems

### Timezone Awareness Critical
- Many tests fail due to timezone-naive datetime operations
- Consistent use of `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` prevents these failures
- Model defaults must use lambda functions for proper timezone handling

### Cache Reliability
- Test cache can have inconsistencies that mask actual test status
- Regular cache validation and cleanup is important
- Duplicate entries in failed/passed lists should be removed

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing remaining 70 failing tests
2. Focus on logic/assertion issues rather than import problems
3. Look for patterns in failures (e.g., more timezone issues, mock configuration)
4. Regular cache validation to ensure accurate test status
