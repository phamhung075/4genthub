# Test Fix Summary - Iteration 53

## Date: 2025-09-13 22:37

## Overview
Successfully fixed 3 repository test files by addressing fundamental mismatches between tests and actual implementation. The main issues were tests calling non-existent methods and using incorrect method names.

## Tests Fixed

### 1. unit_project_repository_test.py
**Issues Fixed**:
- Removed patches for non-existent methods:
  - `_entity_to_model` doesn't exist in ORMProjectRepository
  - `_update_model_from_entity` doesn't exist in ORMProjectRepository
- Fixed cache invalidation method names:
  - Changed `_invalidate_cache` → `invalidate_cache_for_entity`
- Fixed repository method calls:
  - Changed `create()` → `create_project()` or `save()`
  - All instances now use actual repository API methods

### 2. subtask_repository_test.py
**Issues Fixed**:
- Removed patches for non-existent `_from_model_data` method
- Fixed direct method calls that don't exist in implementation
- Cleaned up mock patterns to align with actual repository structure
- Used entity objects directly instead of non-existent conversion methods

### 3. unit_task_repository_test.py
**Issues Fixed**:
- Fixed method call names:
  - `create()` → `save()` (8 occurrences)
  - `get_by_id()` → `find_by_id()` (5 occurrences)
  - `list_all()` → `find_all()` (1 occurrence)
- Fixed attribute references:
  - `_apply_user_filter` → `apply_user_filter`
  - `_get_user_id` → `user_id`
- Fixed user scoped method checks to use correct attribute names

## Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 307
- **Passed**: 48 (15.6%)
- **Failed**: 78 (down from 80 in previous iteration)
- **Fix Rate**: 3 test files comprehensively updated

## Key Patterns Identified

1. **Method Name Mismatches**: Tests were written against old or planned API that doesn't match implementation
2. **Non-existent Private Methods**: Many tests tried to patch private methods that were never implemented
3. **Incorrect Attribute Names**: Tests checked for private attributes when public ones exist
4. **Missing Async Patterns**: Some repository methods that should have been async were not marked properly

## Lessons Learned

1. Tests often lag behind implementation changes
2. Private method mocking should be avoided - test public API instead
3. Repository pattern implementations vary significantly between entities
4. Always verify method existence before patching in tests

## Next Steps

Continue fixing remaining 75 test files using similar patterns:
- Check actual implementation before fixing tests
- Remove patches for non-existent methods
- Update method names to match actual API
- Fix attribute references to use correct names
