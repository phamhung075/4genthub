## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Issue 1: Agent Assignment Authentication Failure ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Component:** Agent Management System
- **Error:** `Agent facade creation requires user authentication. No user ID was provided.`
- **Impact:** Unable to assign agents to branches/tasks
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Status:** Requires authentication system fix

### Issue 2: Branch Statistics Service Error ⚠️ CRITICAL  
- **Component:** Git Branch Statistics
- **Error:** `RepositoryProviderService.get_task_repository() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'`
- **Impact:** Cannot retrieve branch progress metrics
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Status:** Requires service method fix

### Issue 3: Dependencies Format Validation ⚠️ MINOR
- **Component:** Task Creation
- **Error:** `Invalid field: dependencies. Expected: A list of valid task IDs`
- **Impact:** Cannot create tasks with dependencies in single operation
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Workaround:** Use add_dependency after task creation

## System Health Assessment

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Project Management:** All CRUD operations working perfectly
2. **Task Management:** Complete lifecycle management functional
