# Test Fix Iteration 65 - Summary

## Date: 2025-09-24

## Overview
Fixed project_repository_test.py by updating all test methods to use the correct sync repository interface instead of non-existent async methods.

## Files Fixed
1. **agenthub_main/src/tests/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/orm/project_repository_test.py**
   - Status: Fixed (17 tests updated)
   - Issue: Tests were calling async methods that don't exist in the sync repository
   - Solution: Updated all method calls to use sync interface

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Method Call Updates
- `create(project)` → `create_project(name, description, user_id)`
- `get_by_id()` → `get_project()`
- `get_by_name()` → `get_project_by_name()`
- `update()` → `update_project()`
- `delete()` → `delete_project()`
- `list()` → `list_projects()`
- `get_statistics()` → `get_project_statistics()`
- `search()` → `search_projects()`
- `count()` → Removed (async method, replaced with list_projects test)

### 2. Entity Construction Fixes
- Added required `created_at` and `updated_at` fields to all Project instantiations
- Removed `user_id` references (Project entity doesn't have this field)

### 3. Exception Handling Updates
- Changed from `IntegrityError` to `ValidationException` for duplicate names
- Updated generic exception handling for repository methods

### 4. Import Fixes
- Added `ValidationException` import from domain exceptions

## Technical Details
- The repository has both async methods (for new async interface) and sync methods (legacy interface)
- Tests were using the wrong interface - they should use the sync methods
- Project entity requires timestamp fields but doesn't have user_id field
- Repository methods handle user isolation internally

## Current Test Status
- Total tests: 372
- Passing: 345 (92.7%)
- Failing: 3 test files
- This iteration fixed: project_repository_test.py

## Next Steps
- Fix task_repository_test.py (similar issues expected)
- Fix test_role_based_agents.py
- Continue systematic approach of updating tests to match current implementation
