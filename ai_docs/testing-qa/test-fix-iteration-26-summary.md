# Test Fix Iteration 26 Summary

**Date**: 2025-09-24  
**Session**: 36

## Overview
Successfully fixed MockFastAPI missing router attribute issue that was causing test failures in the WebSocket server integration tests.

## Tests Fixed
- **File**: `agenthub_main/src/tests/integration/test_websocket_server.py`
- **Result**: 17 tests passed, 1 skipped (100% success rate for non-skipped tests)
- **Previously**: 1 failed, 13 passed, 1 skipped, 3 errors

## Root Cause Analysis
The WebSocket server implementation was trying to access `self.app.router.routes.append(route)` but the `MockFastAPI` class in conftest.py only had a `routers` attribute (plural) and no `router` attribute.

## Fix Applied
Added router attribute to MockFastAPI class in conftest.py:
```python
# Add router attribute with routes list for WebSocket server compatibility
self.router = type('MockRouter', (), {'routes': []})()
```

This creates a mock router object with an empty routes list that the WebSocket server can append to.

## Technical Details
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'MockFastAPI' object has no attribute 'router'`
- **Location**: Line 111 in `server.py`: `self.app.router.routes.append(route)`
- **Solution**: Mock object now matches the expected interface

## Key Insight
When creating mock objects for testing, it's crucial to ensure they match the interface that the code under test expects. In this case, the WebSocket server expected a `router` attribute with a `routes` list, not just a `routers` list.

## Files Modified
- `agenthub_main/src/tests/conftest.py` - Added router attribute to MockFastAPI class

## Test Pattern Learned
Mock objects must accurately reflect the interface of the real objects they're replacing, including both attributes and their structure.
