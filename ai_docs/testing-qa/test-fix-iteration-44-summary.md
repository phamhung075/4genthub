# Test Fix Iteration 44 Summary

**Date**: 2025-09-24
**Focus**: Service Account Singleton Test Fix

## Summary

Successfully fixed 1 test file (`test_service_account_auth.py`) that had a failing test when run as part of the full test suite.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Singleton Pattern Test Failure
**File**: `test_service_account_auth.py`
**Test**: `test_singleton_instance`

**Problem**: 
- Test passed when run in isolation but failed when run with full test suite
- Error: `TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression`
- Root cause: Singleton state pollution from other tests creating real ServiceAccountAuth instances

**Solution**:
```python
# Save original singleton state
original_instance = fastmcp.auth.service_account._service_auth_instance
fastmcp.auth.service_account._service_auth_instance = None

try:
    # Run test with mocks
    # ...test code...
finally:
    # Restore original singleton state
    fastmcp.auth.service_account._service_auth_instance = original_instance
```

### 2. Async Teardown Method Warnings
**Classes**: `TestServiceAccountAuth` and `TestRealKeycloakIntegration`

**Problem**:
- RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'teardown_method' was never awaited
- pytest doesn't automatically recognize async teardown methods

**Solution**:
```python
# Convert from async teardown:
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def teardown_method(self):
    await self.auth.close()

# To sync teardown that properly runs async code:
async def asyncTearDown(self):
    await self.auth.close()

def teardown_method(self):
    import asyncio
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(self.asyncTearDown())
    finally:
        loop.close()
```

## Key Insights

1. **Singleton Pattern Testing**: When testing singleton patterns, always save and restore the original state to prevent test pollution
2. **Async Teardown in pytest**: pytest doesn't support async teardown_method directly, need to use sync method that runs async code
3. **Test Isolation**: Tests that pass in isolation may fail in full runs due to shared state - proper cleanup is essential

## Current Status

- **Fixed**: 1 test file with 2 classes updated
- **Result**: Test now passes both in isolation and full test run
- **Impact**: Resolved warnings and ensured test suite stability
