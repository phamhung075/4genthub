# Test Fix Iteration 69 Summary

## Date: 2025-09-24 06:45 CEST

## Overview
Partially fixed `task_repository_test.py` by updating tests to match the current implementation API. Made significant progress but test file still has failures.

## Tests Fixed/Updated

### File: `agenthub_main/src/tests/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/orm/task_repository_test.py`

#### Key Changes:
1. **Updated method calls to match actual API**:
   - `list_by_project()` → `list_tasks()` (method doesn't exist)
   - `get_dependencies()` → dependencies accessed via `get_task()` 
   - `get_dependents()` → adapted test since method doesn't exist
   - `bulk_update()` → `batch_update_status()`
   - `get_project_statistics()` → `get_statistics()`
   - `search()` → `search_tasks()`

2. **Fixed import issues**:
   - Added import for TaskPriority value object
   - Fixed datetime timezone usage

3. **Updated mock patterns**:
   - Fixed query chain mocking to match implementation
   - Added patches for internal `_load_task_with_relationships` method
   - Fixed tests using entity objects instead of kwargs

## Progress
- **Before**: 1 passed, 18 failed/errors
- **After**: 6 passed, 8 failed, 5 errors

## Root Cause
The tests were written against an older version of the API that had different method names and signatures. The implementation has evolved but the tests were not updated to match.

## Key Insight
When tests fail due to missing methods or incorrect API usage, always check the current implementation first to see what methods actually exist and how they should be called. Tests must be updated to match the current code, not the other way around.

## Remaining Issues
- Some tests still have incorrect mock setups
- Query chain mocking needs further refinement
- Internal method mocking needs more work

## Files Modified
