# Test Execution Analysis - 2025-09-16

## Current Status

### Problem Summary
The pre_tool_use.py hook is preventing pytest execution because it detects potential file creation in the project root directory. This blocks the standard test execution flow.

### Test Directory Structure
```
dhafnck_mcp_main/
├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── conftest.py (main test configuration)
│   │   ├── pytest.ini (pytest configuration)
│   │   ├── simple_runner.py (custom test runner - created)
│   │   └── Various test directories...
│   └── fastmcp/ (main source code)
```

### Hook Blocking Issue
The pre_tool_use.py hook blocks pytest execution with the error:
```
BLOCKED: Creating files in project root is restricted
Place files in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., ai_docs/, src/, tests/)
```

#### Root Cause
When pytest runs, it attempts to:
1. Create cache files in .pytest_cache directory
2. Potentially create .pyc files if PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE is not set
3. May create test database files or log files

The hook is designed to prevent file creation in the project root, which conflicts with pytest's default behavior.

### Test Import Success
Created a custom test runner that successfully imports test modules:
- tests.shared.infrastructure.messaging.event_bus_test ✓
- tests.monitoring_validation_test ✓
- tests.integration.test_service_account_auth ✓

All imports succeed, indicating the code structure and dependencies are correctly set up.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Directory Structure Issue
There's a nested directory structure:
- Main backend code: `/src/` (root)
- Test code: `/dhafnck_mcp_main/src/tests/`
This mismatch might cause import issues.

#### 2. Test Configuration
The conftest.py includes extensive mocking for:
- numpy (creates mock when not installed)
- supabase (mock client)
- FastAPI (mock routers and dependencies)

#### 3. Environment Variables
Tests set JWT-related environment variables:
- JWT_SECRET_KEY
- JWT_AUDIENCE
- JWT_ISSUER

## Solutions Attempted

### 1. Custom Test Runner
Created `/dhafnck_mcp_main/src/tests/simple_runner.py` that:
- Imports test modules successfully
- Avoids pytest cache creation
- Sets PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

### 2. Alternative Execution Methods
Tried running tests from different directories:
- From project root: BLOCKED
- From dhafnck_mcp_main: BLOCKED
- From src/tests: BLOCKED

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Modify Hook Configuration
Add test execution bypass to the hook:
- Check for TESTING environment variable
- Allow specific file patterns for test execution
- Whitelist .pytest_cache directory creation

### Option 2: Run Tests in Docker Container
Since the project uses Docker:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend pytest src/tests/
```
This would run tests inside the container where hooks don't apply.

### Option 3: Direct Test Execution
Bypass pytest entirely:
1. Import test modules directly
2. Use unittest.TextTestRunner
3. Run tests programmatically without pytest

### Option 4: Disable Hook Temporarily
```bash
export DISABLE_CLAUDE_HOOKS=true
pytest dhafnck_mcp_main/src/tests/
unset DISABLE_CLAUDE_HOOKS
```
(Requires hook modification to check this environment variable)

## Next Steps

1. **Check Docker Option**: Try running tests inside Docker container
2. **Modify Hook**: Add test execution bypass logic
3. **Fix Test Structure**: Align test directory with source code structure
4. **Update Documentation**: Document the proper way to run tests

## Test Files Identified

The following test files exist in the project:
- Event bus tests
- Monitoring validation tests
- Service account authentication tests
- Various unit and integration tests

All test imports succeed, indicating the tests are likely functional once the execution issue is resolved.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Use Docker to run tests if available
2. **Short-term**: Modify hook to allow test execution
3. **Long-term**: Restructure test directory to align with best practices

## Technical Details

### Hook Logic
The pre_tool_use.py hook checks for:
- File creation in root directory
- Directory creation in root
- Specific file type restrictions (.md, .sh, etc.)

### Test Requirements
Tests need to:
- Create temporary cache files
- Write test results
- Potentially create test databases

These requirements conflict with the hook's restrictions, creating the current deadlock.
