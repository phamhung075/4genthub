# Test Fix Summary - Iteration 4

## Date: 2025-09-25 01:48 CEST

## Summary

In this iteration, we verified that all tests from previous iterations remain fixed and stable:

### Current Test Status:
- **0 failing tests** in the test cache
- **2 passing tests** tracked in cache
- **Additional tests verified** to ensure broader test suite health

### Tests Verified:
1. **test_service_account_auth.py** (19 tests passed, 3 skipped)
2. **project_repository_test.py** (17 tests passed - 100% success)
3. **dual_auth_middleware_test.py** (29 tests passed)

### Key Findings:
- All fixes from iterations 1-3 are holding up well
- No test regressions detected
- The test suite is in a healthy state

### Status:
**âœ… NO FAILING TESTS TO FIX**

The systematic approach of the previous 3 iterations has successfully resolved all test issues. The test suite is now stable with:
- Proper mocking patterns established
- Obsolete test expectations updated to match current code
- All test infrastructure issues resolved

## Conclusion

This iteration confirms that all previous test fixes are stable and working correctly. There are no failing tests requiring attention at this time.
