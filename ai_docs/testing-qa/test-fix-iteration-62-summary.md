# Test Fix Iteration 62 Summary

## Date: 2025-09-24

## Starting State
- 344 tests passing (92% coverage)
- 0 failed tests
- 28 untested files

## Action Taken
Ran backend tests including untested files, which exposed 70+ new test failures from previously untested code.

## Files Fixed

### 1. crud_handler_test.py
**Issue**: Tests expected obsolete SubtaskCRUDHandler API
- Old API: `SubtaskCRUDHandler(subtask_service=..., task_service=...)`
- New API: `SubtaskCRUDHandler(response_formatter=..., context_facade=..., task_facade=...)`
**Fix**: Completely rewrote test to match current implementation
**Result**: 4 tests passing → 7 tests passing (out of 16 total)

### 2. test_role_based_agents.py  
**Issue**: Test function had `agent_name` parameter causing pytest fixture error
**Fix**: Converted from script-style test to proper pytest parameterized tests
```python
# Before:
def test_agent_tools(agent_name: str) -> Dict[str, any]:

# After:
@pytest.mark.parametrize("agent_name,role,expectations", get_test_params())
def test_agent_tools(agent_name: str, role: str, expectations: Dict):
```

### 3. task_repository_test.py & project_repository_test.py
**Issue**: Import errors - `TypeError: TaskRepository() takes no arguments`
**Fix**: Changed imports from:
```python
from ...task_repository import TaskRepository
```
To:
```python
from ...task_repository import ORMTaskRepository as TaskRepository
```

### 4. task_repository_test.py (additional fixes)
**Issues**:
- Task entity imported as TaskEntity but used as Task
- Value objects used incorrectly (TaskStatus.TODO instead of TaskStatus.todo())
- Mock ORM objects referenced with wrong class names

**Fixes**:
- Used TaskEntity consistently
- Fixed all value object constructors to use factory methods
- Fixed ORM mock references (TaskAssigneeORM → TaskAssignee)

**Result**: 1 out of 19 tests now passing

## Key Findings

### 1. Fundamental Design Issues in Repository Tests
The repository tests have architectural problems:
- They try to test ORM repositories but pass domain entities instead of kwargs
- The ORM repository's create() method expects `**kwargs`, not entity objects
- Tests mix ORM and domain patterns incorrectly

### 2. Domain Entity Mismatches
- Project entity doesn't have `user_id` field but tests expect it
- Task entity constructor is positional (title, description) with other fields as kwargs
- Value objects use factory methods, not enum constants

### 3. Common Patterns Found
- Obsolete API expectations in test files
- Incorrect imports expecting old class names
- Value object usage errors (using constants instead of factory methods)

## Final State
- Established tests: 344 passing (92%)
- Newly tested files: 4 with partial fixes
- Remaining untested: ~24 files

## Recommendations
1. Repository tests need complete rewrite to properly test ORM layer
2. Consider creating separate integration tests for domain entities
3. Update test documentation to clarify ORM vs domain testing patterns

## Conclusion
Made progress on 4 test files, but uncovered fundamental architectural issues in how repository tests are structured. The tests were written for a different API design and need comprehensive updates to match the current DDD architecture.
