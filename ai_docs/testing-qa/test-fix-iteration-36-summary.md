# Test Fixing Iteration 36 - Summary

## Overview
**Date**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Successfully fixed 1 failing test  
**Total Test Cache Status**: 0 failing tests, 21 passing tests

## Test Fixed
1. **test_service_account_auth.py::TestServiceAccountAuth::test_singleton_instance**
   - **Error**: `TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression`
   - **Root Cause**: httpx.AsyncClient mock was not properly configured for mixed sync/async behavior
   - **Solution**: Used MagicMock for the client object but AsyncMock for the aclose() method

## Technical Details

### Problem
The ServiceAccountAuth class creates httpx.AsyncClient in its synchronous `__init__` method:
```python
self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(...)  # Sync creation
```

But the `close()` method tries to await the client's aclose method:
```python
await self.client.aclose()  # Async close
```

### Fix Applied
Changed the mocking strategy to handle this mixed behavior:
```python
# Create a proper mock client instance
mock_client = MagicMock()  # Regular mock for sync instantiation
# Add aclose as an AsyncMock method
mock_client.aclose = AsyncMock()  # Async mock for the await call
# Configure the constructor to return our mock
mock_client_class.return_value = mock_client
```

## Key Insight
When mocking objects that mix synchronous instantiation with asynchronous methods, you need to carefully choose the right mock type for each part:
- Use `MagicMock` for objects created synchronously
- Use `AsyncMock` for individual methods that will be awaited

## Statistics
- **Tests in failed cache**: 0
- **Tests in passed cache**: 21
- **Total test files**: 372
- **Success rate**: Continuing to maintain stable test suite

## Conclusion
The systematic approach continues to work well. This iteration demonstrates the importance of understanding the nuances of async/sync behavior when writing test mocks, especially for HTTP clients that are created synchronously but used asynchronously.
