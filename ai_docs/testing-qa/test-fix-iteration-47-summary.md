# Test Fix Iteration 47 Summary

## Date: 2025-09-24

## Overview
Successfully fixed an intermittent test failure in `test_service_account_auth.py` related to async mock configuration.

## Tests Fixed

### 1. test_service_account_auth.py::TestServiceAccountAuth::test_singleton_instance
- **Issue**: TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression
- **Root Cause**: The AsyncMock client's `aclose` method wasn't properly configured as an awaitable
- **Fix Applied**: Added explicit `mock_client.aclose = AsyncMock()` to ensure the method is awaitable
- **Key Insight**: When using AsyncMock, sub-methods that will be awaited need explicit AsyncMock configuration

## Technical Details

### The Problem
The test was creating an AsyncMock for the httpx client, but when `await auth1.close()` was called, it internally calls `await self.client.aclose()`. The `aclose` attribute on the mock wasn't configured as an AsyncMock, causing a TypeError when trying to await it.

### The Solution
```python
# Before (implicit mock attribute)
mock_client = AsyncMock()

# After (explicit AsyncMock for aclose)
mock_client = AsyncMock()
mock_client.aclose = AsyncMock()
```

### Test Behavior
- The test was passing when run individually
- Failed when run as part of the full test suite
- This intermittent behavior made it challenging to diagnose

## Current Status
- **0 failing tests** - Test suite is fully stable
- **21 test files** in passed cache
- Test now passes reliably both in isolation and with full suite

## Key Learnings
1. AsyncMock attributes that will be awaited need explicit AsyncMock configuration
2. Tests can behave differently in isolation vs. full suite execution
3. Intermittent failures often indicate state pollution or incomplete mocking

## Files Modified
- `src/tests/integration/test_service_account_auth.py` - Added explicit AsyncMock for aclose method

## Documentation Updated
- CHANGELOG.md - Added Iteration 47 entry
- TEST-CHANGELOG.md - Added Session 48 details
