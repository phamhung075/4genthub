# Test Fixing Iteration 36 - 2025-09-16

## Summary
Fixed 2 test files with API compatibility issues. Both tests were failing because they were calling obsolete API methods or expecting outdated data structures.

## Files Fixed

### 1. test_mcp_authentication_fixes.py
**Issue**: Tests calling deprecated `manage_unified_context` method
**Fix**: Updated to use current `manage_context` method
**Lines Changed**: 192, 263
**Impact**: Integration tests now call the correct API

### 2. create_project_test.py
**Issue**: Tests expecting branch name "main" as dictionary key
**Fix**: Updated to expect UUID keys in git_branchs dictionary
**Methods Fixed**:
- test_create_project_with_main_branch
- test_project_git_branch_creation
- test_full_project_creation_workflow
**Impact**: Tests now match current implementation where branches are stored by UUID

## Key Insights
1. **API Evolution**: Many test failures are due to API changes not being reflected in tests
2. **Data Structure Changes**: Implementation has evolved from using names as keys to using UUIDs
3. **Test Obsolescence Pattern**: Tests expecting old behavior need updating, not the working code

## Status
- **Fixed in this iteration**: 2 test files
- **Total remaining**: 89 test files
- **Success rate improvement**: ~2.2% (2/91 files fixed)

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing remaining 89 test files
2. Focus on API compatibility issues first (quick wins)
3. Update tests to match current implementation, not vice versa
4. Document any additional patterns discovered
