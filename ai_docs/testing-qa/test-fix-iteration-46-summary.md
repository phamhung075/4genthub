# Test Fix Iteration 46 Summary

## Overview
- **Date**: Wed Sep 24 04:14:20 CEST 2025
- **Session**: 47
- **Status**: Successfully fixed singleton test failure

## Summary - Iteration 46

I've successfully completed Iteration 46 of the test fixing process:

### ‚úÖ Achievement:
1. **Fixed `test_service_account_auth.py`**: Resolved singleton test failure
   - Changed mock client from `MagicMock` to `AsyncMock` for proper async operation support
   - Updated assertion from `assert_called_once()` to `assert_awaited_once()` for async `aclose` method
   - Fixed TypeError: "object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression"
   - All 19 tests passing, 3 skipped, 0 failures

### üìä Current Status:
- **0 failing tests** - Test suite returns to perfect stability
- **21 test files** in passed cache
- Documentation updated in CHANGELOG.md and TEST-CHANGELOG.md

### üîç Technical Details:

#### The Problem:
The `test_singleton_instance` test was failing with:
```
E   TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression
```

This occurred when the test tried to await `auth1.close()`, which internally calls `await self.client.aclose()`.

#### Root Cause:
The mock httpx client was created as a regular `MagicMock`, but when the ServiceAccountAuth's `close()` method tried to await the client's `aclose()` method, it failed because MagicMock can't be used in await expressions.

#### The Fix:
1. Changed the mock client from `MagicMock()` to `AsyncMock()`:
   ```python
   # Before:
   mock_client = MagicMock()
   mock_client.aclose = AsyncMock()
   
   # After:
   mock_client = AsyncMock()
   ```

2. Updated the assertion to use the correct async assertion method:
   ```python
   # Before:
   mock_client.aclose.assert_called_once()
   
   # After:
   mock_client.aclose.assert_awaited_once()
   ```

### üí° Key Insights:
- When mocking async operations, always use `AsyncMock` instead of `MagicMock`
- AsyncMock automatically makes all attributes return AsyncMock instances, which can be awaited
- Use `assert_awaited_*` methods for async assertions instead of `assert_called_*`

### üìà Progress:
- Iteration 46 maintains the perfect 0 failing tests status
- The test suite continues to demonstrate stability through systematic fixes
- All async-related warnings have been resolved
