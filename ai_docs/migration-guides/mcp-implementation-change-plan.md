# MCP Implementation Change Plan
## A Practical Approach to Making MCP Work

## 🎯 Executive Summary

After deep analysis, the solution is not to force Claude to always use MCP, but to:
1. **Simplify** MCP to 1-2 functions
2. **Automate** tracking through hooks
3. **Define** clear work units worth tracking
4. **Configure** tracking levels per user needs
5. **Integrate** naturally into Claude's workflow

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### What's Not Working
- Complex MCP API (10+ functions to understand)
- Forcing delegation when Claude could execute directly
- Creating tasks for micro-actions (reading files, status checks)
- Pretending users are watching when they might not be
- Fighting Claude's helpful nature

### What We Need
- Simple API that's easy to use
- Automatic tracking for meaningful work
- Skip tracking for trivial operations
- Honest about when tracking adds value
- Work WITH Claude's nature

## 🏗️ The Change Plan

### Phase 1: Simplification (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Create Simple Wrapper Functions

```python
# Instead of complex MCP API, create simple wrappers

def track_work(description, work_type="task"):
    """Single function to track any work"""
    # Auto-detect project/branch context
    # Auto-create task with sensible defaults
    # Return simple task_id
    
def update_work(task_id, status_or_message):
    """Simple progress update"""
    # Handle both status changes and messages
    
def complete_work(task_id, summary=None):
    """Mark work complete"""
    # Auto-generate summary if not provided
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `mcp_simple.py` with wrapper functions
2. Hide complexity of UUIDs, hierarchies, contexts
3. Auto-detect current project/branch from git
4. Provide sensible defaults for all parameters

#### 1.2 Define Work Unit Granularity

```yaml
TRACK These Work Units:
  Feature: New functionality (> 50 lines)
  Fix: Bug resolution (any size)
  Refactor: Code improvement (> 20 lines)
  Task: Explicit user request
  Investigation: Research/debugging (> 5 minutes)

DON'T TRACK These:
  Reading: File exploration
  Status: Checking git, ls, etc.
  Micro-edits: < 5 lines
  Formatting: Code style changes
  Comments: Unless substantial
```

### Phase 2: Automation (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Hook-Based Auto-Tracking

```python
# .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py enhancement

class AutoMCPTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session_task = None
        self.action_count = 0
        self.meaningful_threshold = 3
    
    def pre_tool_use(self, tool, params):
        if tool in ['Edit', 'Write', 'MultiEdit']:
            self.action_count += 1
            
            if not self.session_task and self.action_count >= self.meaningful_threshold:
                # Auto-create session task after 3 meaningful actions
                self.session_task = auto_create_session_task()
                
        return {'task_id': self.session_task}
```

**Implementation:**
1. Track actions within a session
2. Auto-create MCP task after threshold
3. Aggregate micro-actions into session task
4. Complete task on session end

#### 2.2 Session-Based Tracking

```python
# One task per user request session

Session Start: User asks "Fix the authentication bug"
    ↓
Auto-create: MCP Task "Fix authentication bug"
    ↓
All actions tracked under this task
    ↓
Session End: Task auto-completed with summary
```

### Phase 3: Natural Integration (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Trigger Word Detection

```python
MCP_TRIGGERS = {
    'explicit': ['track', 'task', 'project', 'ticket'],
    'implicit': ['feature', 'fix', 'bug', 'implement', 'build'],
    'skip': ['quick', 'just', 'check', 'read', 'look']
}

def should_track(user_message):
    message_lower = user_message.lower()
    
    # Explicit triggers always track
    if any(trigger in message_lower for trigger in MCP_TRIGGERS['explicit']):
        return True
    
    # Skip triggers never track
    if any(trigger in message_lower for trigger in MCP_TRIGGERS['skip']):
        return False
    
    # Implicit triggers track for substantial work
    if any(trigger in message_lower for trigger in MCP_TRIGGERS['implicit']):
        return True
    
    # Default based on complexity
    return estimate_complexity(user_message) > COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD
```

#### 3.2 Progressive Enhancement

```yaml
Tracking Levels:
  none: No MCP tracking
  minimal: Only explicit requests
  normal: Major work units (default)
  full: All modifications
  
User Configuration:
  .claude/config.yml:
    mcp_tracking_level: normal
    mcp_dashboard_url: "https://..."  # If they have one
    mcp_auto_create: true
```

### Phase 4: Instruction Updates (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Simplified CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# MCP Work Tracking

## Simple Rule
Track MEANINGFUL WORK, skip trivial operations.

## What's Meaningful?
- Features (new functionality)
- Fixes (bug resolution)
- Refactors (code improvement)
- Tasks (user requests)

## What's Trivial?
- Reading files
- Status checks
- Micro-edits (< 5 lines)
- Formatting

## How to Track
```python
# Start of meaningful work
task_id = track_work("Fixing authentication bug")

# Optional progress updates
update_work(task_id, "Found the issue")

# Complete when done
complete_work(task_id, "Fixed null check in auth.js")
```

That's it. The system handles the rest.
```

#### 4.2 Honest Communication

```markdown
## When to Mention MCP

Say: "I'll track this work as a task"
When: Starting meaningful work

Say: "Task completed - [summary]"
When: Finishing meaningful work

Don't Say: "Users are watching the dashboard"
Unless: You know they actually are

Don't Say: "Creating task for visibility"
For: Every micro-action
```

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Adjustment (Ongoing)

#### 5.1 Success Metrics

```yaml
Track These:
  - Average actions per MCP task (target: 5-20)
  - User satisfaction with tracking level
  - Time overhead from MCP (target: < 5%)
  - Meaningful vs noise ratio

Don't Track:
  - MCP usage percentage (meaningless)
  - Compliance rate (forced metric)
  - Task count (more ≠ better)
```

#### 5.2 Feedback Loop

```python
# Collect data on what works
- Which triggers accurately predict meaningful work?
- What granularity do users prefer?
- Where does automation help vs hinder?

# Adjust based on reality
- Tune thresholds
- Refine triggers
- Simplify further
```

- No tracking overhead for quick tasks
- Configurable to your preferences
- Honest about trade-offs
```

### For Claude
```markdown
New simple approach:
- Use track_work() for meaningful tasks
- System handles the complexity
- Skip tracking for trivial operations
- Focus on helping users
```

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Success Looks Like
- MCP used for 30-40% of work (meaningful units)
- < 5% performance overhead
- Users see valuable tracking, not noise
- Claude uses MCP naturally, not forced

### Failure Indicators
- Still fighting Claude's nature
- Complex rules and exceptions
- Users complaining about overhead
- Tracking noise exceeds signal

## 🔑 The Bottom Line

**Make MCP so simple and automatic that it enhances rather than hinders Claude's natural helpfulness.**

The change plan focuses on:
1. **Simplification** - One function, not ten
2. **Automation** - Hooks do the work
3. **Intelligence** - Track what matters
4. **Honesty** - About value and trade-offs
5. **Iteration** - Adjust based on reality

This is achievable, practical, and respects both user needs and Claude's nature.
