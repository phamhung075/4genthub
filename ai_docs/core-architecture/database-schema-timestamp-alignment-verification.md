### Clean Timestamp Pattern Analysis

#### âœ… Audit Timestamps (Auto-managed by event handlers)
- **created_at**: Automatically set on INSERT operations
- **updated_at**: Automatically updated on UPDATE operations
- **UTC enforcement**: Handled by timestamp_events.py
- **Consistent across databases**: Both use TIMESTAMP type

#### âœ… Business Timestamps (Manually managed)
- **completed_at**: Set when tasks/subtasks are marked as 'done'
- **assigned_at**: Set when assignments are created
- **last_used_at**: Updated on API token usage
- **expires_at**: Set based on business rules
- **ai_last_execution**: Updated when AI agents work on tasks
- **processed_at**: Set when context delegations are processed
- **last_hit**: Updated on cache access

### Trigger Analysis

Both databases properly separate concerns:

#### âœ… Task Count Triggers (Business Logic)
- Handle task counting and statistics
- **Explicitly avoid timestamp updates** with comments:
  - SQLite: "no timestamp update - application layer handles timestamps"
  - PostgreSQL: "no timestamp update - application layer handles timestamps"

#### âœ… No Timestamp Triggers
- No automatic timestamp triggers found
- Clean separation between business logic and audit timestamps

### Schema Consistency Verification

#### âœ… Column Definitions
- All timestamp columns use identical type definitions
- NOT NULL constraints match where required
- Default values consistent across databases

#### âœ… Index Alignment
- Both databases have timestamp indexes for performance
- `idx_tasks_created_at` exists in both schemas
- Cache expiry indexes properly implemented

#### âœ… Comment Consistency
- PostgreSQL includes helpful column comments
- SQLite relies on clear column naming
- Both include trigger documentation about clean timestamp handling

## Recommendations

### âœ… Current State Assessment
1. **Schema alignment is excellent** - no discrepancies found
2. **Clean timestamp patterns properly implemented** in both databases
3. **Separation of concerns maintained** between audit and business timestamps
4. **Event handler integration ready** for both database types

### ðŸ”§ Future Maintenance
1. **Continue using TIMESTAMP type** for both databases (optimal compatibility)
2. **Maintain separation** between auto-managed and business timestamps
3. **Keep trigger documentation** about clean timestamp handling
4. **Monitor schema migrations** to ensure continued alignment

## Conclusion

âœ… **PostgreSQL and SQLite schemas are perfectly aligned** for clean timestamp management.

âœ… **No action required** - both databases properly implement:
- Consistent timestamp column definitions
- Proper NULL/NOT NULL constraints
- Clean separation between audit and business timestamps
- Compatible trigger designs that avoid timestamp conflicts
- Identical indexing strategies for performance

The database infrastructure is ready for clean timestamp implementation across both platforms.
