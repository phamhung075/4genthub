- Immutable creation timestamp enforcement

```python
@dataclass
class BaseTimestampEntity(ABC):

    created_at: datetime | None = None
    updated_at: datetime | None = None

    @abstractmethod
    def _get_entity_id(self) -> str:
        """Return unique identifier for events and logging."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def _validate_entity(self) -> None:
        """Enforce business rules and invariants."""
        pass

    def touch(self, reason: str = "entity_updated") -> None:
        """The ONLY method for updating timestamps."""
        # Centralized timestamp update logic
```
