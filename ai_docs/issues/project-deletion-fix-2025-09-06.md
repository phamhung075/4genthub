# Project Deletion Fix - GitBranchRepository Constructor Issue

## Date: 2025-09-06

## Problem
Project deletion was failing with error: "GitBranchRepository() takes no arguments"

## Root Cause
The `ORMGitBranchRepository` class constructor only accepts a `user_id` parameter, but the code in `ProjectManagementService.delete_project()` was trying to instantiate it with both `db_session` and `user_id`:

```python
# INCORRECT - This was causing the error
git_branch_repo = GitBranchRepository(db_session, user_id=self._user_id)
```

The actual constructor signature is:
```python
class ORMGitBranchRepository(BaseORMRepository[ProjectGitBranch], GitBranchRepository):
    def __init__(self, user_id: Optional[str] = None):
        super().__init__(ProjectGitBranch)
        self.user_id = user_id
```

## Solution
Fixed the instantiation to only pass the `user_id` parameter:

```python
# CORRECT - Repository manages its own session
from ...infrastructure.repositories.orm.git_branch_repository import ORMGitBranchRepository
git_branch_repo = ORMGitBranchRepository(user_id=self._user_id)
```

The repository manages its own database session internally through the `get_db_session()` context manager inherited from `BaseORMRepository`.

## Files Modified
- `agenthub_main/src/fastmcp/task_management/application/services/project_management_service.py`
  - Line 195: Fixed repository instantiation for branch validation
  - Lines 237-242: Used `get_session()` directly for task count queries
  - Line 262: Fixed repository instantiation for branch deletion
  - Lines 278-300: Added comprehensive debugging and verification

## Debug Output Added
Enhanced logging to track the deletion process:
- `[DEBUG] Found X branches for project Y`
- `[DEBUG] Branch Z has N tasks`
- `[DEBUG] Starting deletion process for project`
- `[DEBUG] Deleting branch X for project Y`
- `[DEBUG] Branch deletion result: True/False`
- `[DEBUG] Verification after delete - project found: True/False`

## Testing Instructions
1. Create a test project with only the main branch
2. Try to delete the project
3. Check backend logs for `[DEBUG]` messages
4. Verify project is actually removed from database

## Status
âœ… FIXED - Repository instantiation corrected to match constructor signature
