- **Availability Target:** 99.9% uptime
- **Performance Target:** <2 second response time recovery

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Infrastructure Failure

**Symptoms:**
- All services unresponsive
- Infrastructure completely inaccessible
- Network connectivity lost

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Assess Scope (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Check external monitoring
curl -f https://status.dhafnck-mcp.com/api/health
ping production-server-ip

# Verify DNS resolution
nslookup dhafnck-mcp.com
```

2. **Activate Disaster Recovery Site (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Switch to DR environment
export ENVIRONMENT=disaster-recovery
export DR_REGION=us-west-2

# Deploy to DR infrastructure
./scripts/deployment/deploy-production.sh \
    --environment disaster-recovery \
    --force
```

3. **Restore Data (2 hours)**
```bash
# Restore database from latest backup
./scripts/restore-database.sh \
    --backup-location s3://dhafnck-mcp-backups/latest \
    --environment disaster-recovery

# Validate data integrity
./scripts/validate-data-integrity.sh
```

4. **Update DNS (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Point DNS to DR environment
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
    --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 \
    --change-batch file://dns-failover.json
```

5. **Validate Service Recovery (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Full system validation
./scripts/deployment/health-checks/comprehensive-health-check.sh \
    --environment disaster-recovery \
    --timeout 120
```

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption/Loss

**Symptoms:**
- Database connection errors
- Data corruption detected
- Database server unresponsive

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Isolate Database (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Stop application connections
docker-compose -f docker-system/docker-compose.production.yml stop mcp-backend

# Backup current state (even if corrupted)
./scripts/backup-current-state.sh --force
```

2. **Assess Corruption (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Check database integrity
docker-compose exec postgres pg_dump --schema-only dhafnck_mcp > schema_check.sql

# Verify backup availability
aws s3 ls s3://dhafnck-mcp-backups/ --recursive | tail -10
```

3. **Restore from Backup (1 hour)**
```bash
# Find most recent clean backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(aws s3 ls s3://dhafnck-mcp-backups/ | sort | tail -1)

# Restore database
./scripts/restore-database.sh \
    --backup-file "$LATEST_BACKUP" \
    --force-overwrite

# Run database migrations if needed
docker-compose exec mcp-backend python -m alembic upgrade head
```

4. **Validate Data Integrity (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Run data integrity checks
./scripts/validate-data-integrity.sh

# Test critical queries
./scripts/test-database-queries.sh
```

5. **Restart Services (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Start application services
docker-compose -f docker-system/docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Verify functionality
./scripts/deployment/health-checks/comprehensive-health-check.sh --environment production
```

### Scenario 3: Security Breach

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access detected
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Security alerts triggered

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Immediate Isolation (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Block all traffic
sudo ufw deny in
sudo ufw deny out

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-system/docker-compose.production.yml down
```

2. **Assessment (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Export logs for forensics
./scripts/export-security-logs.sh

# Check for data breach indicators
./scripts/security/breach-assessment.sh

# Identify compromised systems
./scripts/security/compromise-assessment.sh
```

3. **Credential Rotation (45 minutes)**
```bash
# Rotate all secrets
./scripts/security/rotate-all-credentials.sh

# Update JWT secrets
./scripts/security/rotate-jwt-secrets.sh

# Reset user sessions
./scripts/security/invalidate-all-sessions.sh
```

4. **Clean Restoration (2 hours)**
```bash
# Restore from pre-breach backup
CLEAN_BACKUP=$(./scripts/find-clean-backup.sh --before-incident)

# Deploy clean environment
./scripts/deployment/deploy-production.sh \
    --environment production \
    --clean-restore \
    --backup-location "$CLEAN_BACKUP"
```

5. **Security Hardening (1 hour)**
```bash
# Apply additional security measures
./scripts/security/emergency-hardening.sh

# Enable enhanced monitoring
./scripts/security/enable-enhanced-monitoring.sh

# Notify stakeholders
./scripts/security/breach-notification.sh
```

### Scenario 4: Application Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Application errors in logs
- API endpoints returning 500 errors
- Services failing health checks

**Recovery Steps:**

1. **Quick Assessment (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-system/docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Review recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=100 mcp-backend

# Identify error patterns
./scripts/troubleshooting/analyze-errors.sh
```

2. **Attempt Service Restart (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Restart backend service
docker-compose -f docker-system/docker-compose.production.yml restart mcp-backend

# Wait for stabilization
sleep 60

# Check health
./scripts/deployment/health-checks/comprehensive-health-check.sh --environment production
```

3. **Rollback if Restart Fails (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Execute rollback to last known good version
./scripts/deployment/rollback/rollback-production.sh \
    --environment production \
    --auto-confirm
```

4. **Root Cause Analysis (Ongoing)**
```bash
# Collect diagnostic information
