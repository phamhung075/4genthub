# Understanding MCP Context System - The AI's Cloud Notebook

## What MCP Context Really Is

Think of the MCP Context System as a **cloud-based notebook** that AI agents can read from and write to. It's like a shared piece of paper in the cloud where AIs can leave notes for themselves and other AIs.

### Key Reality Check ⚠️

1. **MCP CANNOT modify AI's built-in tools** - Claude Code and Cursor have their own file read/write tools that we cannot change
2. **MCP CANNOT automatically capture what AI does** - The AI must manually write to this notebook
3. **AI must CHECK the notebook** - Before and after doing work, AI should read the notebook
4. **AI must UPDATE the notebook** - After doing work, AI should write what it did

## How It Actually Works

### The Manual Process
```
1. AI starts work
   ↓
2. AI reads context from MCP (manual check)
   ↓
3. AI does work with its built-in tools
   ↓
4. AI writes updates to MCP (manual update)
   ↓
5. Next AI reads the updates
```

### What AI Agents Can Do

#### Claude Code & Cursor Built-in Tools (We CANNOT modify these):
- `Read` - Read files from project
- `Edit` - Modify files
- `Write` - Create new files
- `Bash` - Run commands
- `Search` - Search in codebase

#### MCP Context Tools (Our notebook system):
- `manage_context` - Read/write to the cloud notebook
- `manage_task` - Track tasks and progress
- `manage_subtask` - Break down work

## The Smart Workflow Pattern

Since we can't automatically capture, we need AI to be disciplined:

### 1. Before Starting Work - Check the Notebook
```python
# AI should always check context first
context = mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_context(
    action="get",
    level="task",
    context_id=current_task_id,
    include_inherited=True
)

# See what was done before
previous_work = context.get("data", {}).get("progress", [])
files_modified = context.get("data", {}).get("files_modified", [])
decisions_made = context.get("data", {}).get("decisions", [])
```

### 2. During Work - Remember What You're Doing
AI should keep track mentally of:
- What files it reads
- What files it modifies
- What decisions it makes
- What it discovers

### 3. After Work - Update the Notebook
```python
# AI must manually update context with what it did
mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_context(
    action="update",
    level="task",
    context_id=current_task_id,
    data={
        "progress": [
            "Read auth/config.py to understand current setup",
            "Modified auth/jwt.py to add refresh token logic",
            "Created tests/test_jwt_refresh.py"
        ],
        "files_modified": [
            "auth/jwt.py",
            "tests/test_jwt_refresh.py"
        ],
        "discoveries": [
            "Found existing Redis client in utils/cache.py",
            "JWT library already supports refresh tokens"
        ],
        "decisions": [
            "Use Redis for refresh token storage",
            "Set refresh token expiry to 30 days"
        ],
        "next_steps": [
            "Add rate limiting to refresh endpoint",
            "Update API documentation"
        ]
    }
)
```

## Making It Semi-Automatic Through Patterns

While we can't modify AI tools, we can create patterns that make updates easier:

### 1. Task Creation Auto-Generates Context Template
When a task is created, it can include a context template:

```python
# System creates task with reminder
task = create_task(
    title="Implement JWT refresh tokens",
    description="""
    REMEMBER TO UPDATE CONTEXT:
    - Files you read
    - Files you modify
    - Decisions you make
    - What you discover
    """
)
```

### 2. Progressive Prompting
The system can remind AI through task descriptions:

```python
# After 30 minutes without update
task.update_description("""
    ⚠️ CONTEXT UPDATE NEEDED
    Last update: 30 minutes ago
    Please update context with:
    - Current progress
    - Files modified
    - Any blockers
""")
```

### 3. Context Templates in Responses
When AI queries for next task, include context template:

```python
# System returns next task with template
{
    "task": {
        "id": "task-123",
        "title": "Add authentication"
    },
    "context_template": {
        "files_read": [],
        "files_modified": [],
        "decisions": [],
        "discoveries": [],
        "blockers": []
    },
    "reminder": "Please update context after work"
}
```

## Best Practices for AI Agents

### 1. Start Every Session
```python
# Check what branch you're on
branch_context = manage_context(action="get", level="branch", context_id=branch_id)

# Get your current task
current_task = manage_task(action="next", git_branch_id=branch_id)

# Read task context
task_context = manage_context(action="get", level="task", context_id=current_task.id)
```

### 2. Update After Significant Work
```python
# After implementing a feature
manage_context(
    action="add_progress",
    level="task", 
    context_id=task_id,
    content="Implemented JWT refresh token generation"
)

# After discovering something important
manage_context(
    action="add_insight",
    level="task",
    context_id=task_id,
    content="Redis connection already configured in app config",
    category="discovery"
)
```

### 3. Complete Tasks with Summary
```python
# Always complete with detailed summary
manage_task(
    action="complete",
    task_id=task_id,
    completion_summary="""
    Implemented JWT refresh tokens:
    - Modified auth/jwt.py for token generation
    - Added Redis storage for refresh tokens
    - Created comprehensive tests
    - Updated API documentation
    """,
    testing_notes="All tests passing, 95% coverage"
)
```

## Why This Manual Process Matters

1. **Knowledge Preservation** - Next AI (or you tomorrow) knows what was done
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Other AIs can see progress and continue work
3. **Decision Tracking** - Understand why choices were made
4. **Progress Visibility** - Humans can see what AI is doing
5. **Pattern Learning** - Discover reusable solutions

## The Cloud Sync Part

While capture isn't automatic, the notebook sync IS automatic:

1. **When AI writes to notebook** → Automatically synced to cloud
2. **When AI reads from notebook** → Automatically gets latest from cloud
3. **Multiple AIs** → All see the same notebook (eventually consistent)
4. **Network failures** → Local journal ensures no data loss

## Summary

MCP Context System is:
- ✅ A cloud notebook for AI agents
- ✅ Manually updated by AI after work
- ✅ Automatically synced across agents
- ❌ NOT able to modify AI's built-in tools
- ❌ NOT able to automatically capture AI actions

The key is creating good habits and patterns so AI agents remember to check and update their notebook!
