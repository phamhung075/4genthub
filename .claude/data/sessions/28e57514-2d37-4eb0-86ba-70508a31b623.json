    "I want to test the MCP auto-injection system that was just implemented. Please:\n\n  1. First, tell me what context you have about:\n     - Current git branch and uncommitted changes\n     - Any pending MCP tasks\n     - Recent commits\n     - Project context from the session hook\n\n  2. Check if you can access the MCP server by:\n     - Querying for pending tasks using the MCP HTTP client\n     - Checking if token authentication is working\n     - Verifying cache is functioning\n\n  3. Test the fallback strategies:\n     - What happens if the MCP server is unavailable?\n     - Can you still get context from cache?\n     - Does the static fallback work?\n\n  4. Validate the performance metrics:\n     - How many tokens did the auto-injection use?\n     - How long did session startup take?\n     - What's the cache hit rate?\n\n  5. Test task management:\n     - List my current tasks in the MCP system\n     - Get the next recommended task\n     - Show task dependencies and status\n\n  6. Verify the hook system:\n     - Check if session_start.py hook loaded correctly\n     - Confirm the MCP context was injected\n     - Validate that git status was captured\n\n  Please provide a detailed report on what context you received automatically and whether the \n  auto-injection system is working as expected. Include any errors or issues you encounter.\n\n  Finally, compare this session to a normal session without MCP injection - what additional context\n   do you have that you wouldn't normally have?"
