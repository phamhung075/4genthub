    "call agent review this\n\n  Key Features Implemented:\n\n  1. \ud83c\udfad Role-Based Security: Each agent gets tools appropriate for their role\n    - Management agents: Can delegate but cannot edit files (security boundary)\n    - Security agents: Read-only analysis, no file modification\n    - Development agents: Full file editing for code implementation\n    - Testing agents: Can write tests + browser automation\n    - Documentation agents: Can write docs and specs\n    - Architecture agents: Can write specs + UI component access\n  2. \ud83d\udd04 Universal Capabilities: All agents can:\n    - Use task management tools (manage_task, manage_subtask)\n    - Assign other agents to tasks (manage_agent)\n    - Read files for analysis (Read, Grep, Glob)\n  3. \ud83d\udd12 Security Boundaries:\n    - Task planning agents cannot modify files (delegation only)\n    - Security agents cannot modify files (analysis only)\n    - Development agents have full file access (implementation)\n\n  Example Role Assignments:\n\n  - task-planning-agent: \u2705 Can assign agents, \u274c Cannot write files\n  - security-auditor-agent: \u2705 Can analyze, \u274c Cannot write files\n  - coding-agent: \u2705 Can write code, \u2705 Can execute commands\n  - test-orchestrator-agent: \u2705 Can write tests, \u2705 Browser automation\n\n  Implementation:\n\n  - _get_role_based_tools(): Analyzes agent category/slug to assign appropriate tools\n  - Role detection: Based on agent category and slug patterns\n  - MCP tool integration: Includes MCP tools from YAML config when role-appropriate\n  - No hardcoding: All tools extracted from agent configuration files\n\n  The system now properly respects agent roles - management agents focus on\n  coordination and delegation while development agents have the tools needed for\n  implementation! \ud83c\udfaf\ndeeper thinking for assume it logic and correct",
