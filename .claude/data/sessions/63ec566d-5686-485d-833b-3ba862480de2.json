    "\u2022 Objective: To understand how the system works, identify all relevant files, and locate where a problem is situated.\n\u2022 Method: Use a detailed research prompt designed to produce file names and line numbers. This allows the agent to know exactly where to look without having to search through numerous files.\n\u2022 Importance: A misunderstanding at the research stage (e.g., a bad line of research, a misunderstanding of how the system works, data flows, or where things happen) can lead to thousands of bad lines of code later in the process. It is crucial to dedicate time to properly specify the problem and ensure the agent comprehends the system's operation. Human review of the research output helps in catching problems early.\n\u2022 Output: A detailed set of information, typically generated by a research prompt, which includes file names and line numbers. This precise output enables the agent to pinpoint exact locations for further action.\nfor each agent you need add these information on his base yaml"
