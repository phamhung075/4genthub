    "\u2022 Objective: To understand how the system works, identify all relevant files, and locate where a problem is situated.\n\u2022 Method: Use a detailed research prompt designed to produce file names and line numbers. This allows the agent to know exactly where to look without having to search through numerous files.\n\u2022 Importance: A misunderstanding at the research stage (e.g., a bad line of research, a misunderstanding of how the system works, data flows, or where things happen) can lead to thousands of bad lines of code later in the process. It is crucial to dedicate time to properly specify the problem and ensure the agent comprehends the system's operation. Human review of the research output helps in catching problems early.\n\u2022 Output: A detailed set of information, typically generated by a research prompt, which includes file names and line numbers. This precise output enables the agent to pinpoint exact locations for further action.\nfor each agent you need add these information on his base yaml",
    "i have reverse your change because it not corerct, i demande change on base yaml, not on .md",

    "need analyze actual base follow this guide:\n2. Planning Phase\n\u2022 Objective: To describe every change the agent will make, not line by line, but by including the files and snippets of what will be modified. It also explicitly outlines how testing and verification will be conducted at each step.\n\u2022 Method: Utilize a planning prompt that guides the agent in creating a detailed plan.\n\u2022 Importance: A flawed part of the plan can result in hundreds of incorrect lines of code. The plan is generally much shorter than the actual code changes, making it easier to review. Human review and validation of plans are essential for maintaining mental alignment within the team and fostering a shared understanding of the codebase. Catching problems at this planning stage is crucial for efficiency.\n\u2022 Output: A detailed plan that describes each proposed change, identifies the specific files and code snippets involved, and specifies the testing and verification procedures."
