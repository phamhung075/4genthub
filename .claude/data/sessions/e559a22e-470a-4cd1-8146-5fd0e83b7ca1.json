    " I've created two comprehensive guides for AI task planning with MCP:\n\n  \ud83d\udcda Created Documentation:\n\n  1. AI Task Planning Master Prompt (ai_docs/development-guides/ai-task-planning-prompt.md)\n    - Complete task planning methodology\n    - Task breakdown structure templates\n    - File helper context for each task\n    - Agent assignment matrix\n    - Dependency management\n    - Quality assurance criteria\n    - Best practices\n  2. MCP Task Creation Complete Guide (ai_docs/development-guides/mcp-task-creation-guide.md)\n    - Exact MCP tool syntax with real function calls\n    - Complete task creation examples with full context\n    - Subtask management\n    - Progress tracking methods\n    - Task search and discovery\n    - Dependency management\n    - Real-world authentication system example\n\n  \ud83c\udfaf Key Features Included:\n\n  Task Creation Template:\n  - Clear objectives and current/target state\n  - Files to read, modify, and create\n  - Technical approach step-by-step\n  - Testing requirements\n  - Acceptance criteria\n  - Full implementation context\n\n  File Helper Context:\n  - Files to read (with purpose and focus areas)\n  - Files to modify (with line numbers and change types)\n  - Files to create (with templates)\n  - Test files (with test cases)\n  - Documentation files (with sections)\n\n  Agent Assignment Rules:\n  - Automatic agent selection based on keywords\n  - Multi-agent assignment for complex tasks\n  - 33 specialized agents mapped to task types\n\n  Complete MCP Syntax:\n  mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_task(\n      action=\"create\",\n      git_branch_id=\"...\",\n      title=\"...\",\n      assignees=\"...\",\n      details=\"[FULL CONTEXT]\"\n  )\n\n  \ud83d\udccb The guides provide:\n\n  1. For Task Planning:\n    - Requirement analysis framework\n    - Task breakdown structure\n    - Dependency graphs\n    - Implementation sequences\n  2. For Task Creation:\n    - Exact MCP function signatures\n    - Parameter descriptions\n    - Context templates\n    - Real examples\n  3. For Progress Tracking:\n    - Update methods\n    - Completion summaries\n    - Testing notes\n    - Progress percentages\n  4. For Quality Assurance:\n    - Definition of done\n    - Review criteria\n    - Documentation requirements\n    - Testing standards\n\n  This complete prompt system enables AI to:\n  - Plan complex projects comprehensively\n  - Create detailed, actionable tasks in MCP\n  - Include all necessary file context\n  - Assign appropriate agents\n  - Track progress effectively\n  - Ensure quality deliverables\n\n  The guides can be used immediately for any task planning and creation in the MCP system.",
