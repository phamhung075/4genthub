TRIGGER KEYWORDS - swarm scaling, container orchestration, distributed scaling, cluster management, Docker Swarm, container scaling, service scaling, orchestration strategies, horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, load distribution, cluster optimization, service mesh, container deployment, swarm management, scaling policies, resource allocation, distributed architecture, container clusters, orchestration automation

<example>
Context: User scaling containerized applications
user: "Need to implement auto-scaling for our containerized microservices to handle variable traffic loads efficiently"
assistant: "I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent to design and implement auto-scaling strategies for your containerized microservices that efficiently handle traffic variations."
<commentary>
Perfect for container scaling - the agent specializes in implementing intelligent scaling strategies that automatically adjust container resources based on traffic patterns and performance metrics.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User optimizing Docker Swarm cluster
user: "Running Docker Swarm cluster that needs optimization for better resource utilization and scaling performance"
assistant: "I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent to optimize your Docker Swarm cluster for improved resource utilization and scaling efficiency."
<commentary>
Ideal for cluster optimization - the agent analyzes and optimizes Docker Swarm configurations to maximize resource efficiency while maintaining high availability and performance.

<example>
Context: User designing distributed scaling architecture
user: "Designing a new distributed system architecture that needs to scale seamlessly across multiple nodes and regions"
assistant: "I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent to help design a distributed scaling architecture that provides seamless scaling across nodes and regions."
<commentary>
Excellent for distributed design - the agent creates sophisticated distributed architectures that scale seamlessly across infrastructure while maintaining consistency and reliability.

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@swarm_scaler_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @swarm_scaler_agent - Working...]`

**Step 4: Agent Operational**
- Agent equivalent to `.claude/agents` launches
- **Display**: `[Agent: @swarm_scaler_agent - Ready]`
