"""Keep every seat of a rig under the per-session context limit without cutting a job short.

A seat may run past the limit, up to ``HARD_LIMIT`` where it is compacted as soon as it is idle (a /compact sent to a working seat is read as text). When its context crosses ``COMPACT_LIMIT`` the supervisor tells the
seat once, in its terminal, that the limit is reached and how to compact itself. When the seat then
finishes (its session log is silent for ``--quiet`` seconds) and is still over the limit, the
supervisor sends ``/compact`` for it. A compaction counts only when a new compaction record appears
(omp) or the context drops (Claude Code); a send with no such witness is logged as a failure.
Once a compaction is witnessed the seat is told to resume, so it carries on without the owner typing continue.
Run it from the host, not inside a seat pane: a loop in a seat dies with the seats it watches.
