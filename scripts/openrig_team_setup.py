"""Create the 4genthub development team as an OpenRig room through the 4genthub API.

The team definition (room, seats, links, context modules, overlays) is data in
``scripts/team/4genthub/team.json``; the module texts are the files next to it.
``apply`` pushes that definition in a fixed order and is idempotent::

    1. seat types        POST /api/v2/openrig/seat-types/seed        (the seats need them;
                         idempotent, the server needs AGENTHUB_PUBLIC_URL)
    2. context modules   PUT  /api/v2/openrig/modules/{slug}/versions/{version}
    3. room              POST /api/v2/openrig/rooms                  (409 exists: ok)
    4. seats             POST /api/v2/openrig/rooms/{room}/seats     (409 exists: ok)
    5. links             PUT  /api/v2/openrig/rooms/{room}/seats/{seat}/links
    6. company overlay   PUT  /api/v2/openrig/overlay
    7. seat overlays     PUT  /api/v2/openrig/rooms/{room}/seats/{seat}/overlay

Overlay PUTs replace the previous overlay of their scope, so the full op list is
sent every time. Any other HTTP error stops the run.

``import-project`` reads the current project's local Claude configuration and pushes
it as module versions through the same ``PUT`` call ``apply`` uses::

  1. .mcp.json         one ``mcp`` module per server entry (name, type http|stdio,
                       url, or command + args, headers/env)
  2. .claude/skills/*  one ``skill`` block per directory: the SKILL.md text plus its
                       source path and sha256

The project root is the one the Claude-code hooks derive, imported from
``utils/env_loader.get_project_root`` (never re-derived here). A block never carries a
secret value: a credential-shaped literal is refused with a clear message, while a value
that names ``${ENV_VAR}`` is stored verbatim for the client runtime to expand.

Because a module version is an immutable row keyed by a concrete semver, ``import-project``
resolves each module against what the server already stores before it sends anything
(``GET /api/v2/openrig/modules/{slug}/versions/{version}``): the stored version is
published unchanged when its content is identical (SKIP), a version that does not exist is
pushed as given (PUSH), and a stored version whose content differs moves to the next patch
(NEW-VERSION, mirroring the backend's ``NextPatchVersion``) so a changed file lands as a
new version instead of overwriting an immutable one or failing.

``publish-skills`` pushes the skill library as catalog blocks: it reads the inventory
``ai_docs/agent-system/skill-library.json`` (52 skills, each with the committed path and
sha256 of its SKILL.md) and sends ONE ``skill`` block per skill through the same ``PUT``.
A skill committed on two edges (canonical and plugin) is ONE block, with the canonical copy
as ``source_path``/``sha256`` and the plugin copy as ``mirror_path``/``mirror_sha256``. The
inventory carries paths, not text, so the OpenRig checkout they are relative to is named by
``--source-root`` (or ``OPENRIG_SKILLS_ROOT``); the file read is verified against the
inventory's digest, so a stale inventory fails loudly instead of publishing a block whose
provenance is already wrong. It shares ``import-project``'s resolve-then-push idempotence.

A published skill block records where it came from: its content JSON carries ``source_path``
(the repo-relative path of the committed file) and ``sha256`` (the digest of that file's bytes
as committed). The two canonical/plugin overlap blocks also carry ``mirror_path`` and
``mirror_sha256`` for the copy they mirror. ``drift-check`` is the read-only counterpart of that
provenance: it lists the stored modules (``GET /api/v2/openrig/modules``), reads every stored
``skill`` block, and compares each recorded digest with the sha256 of the file at its path under
the root that path is relative to.

Two publishers write provenance with different path bases, so two roots are resolved in order.
``--root`` (default: the hooks-derived project root) holds ``import-project``'s paths, relative
to THIS project (``.claude/skills/<dir>/SKILL.md``). ``--library-root`` (default:
``$OPENRIG_SKILLS_ROOT``) holds ``publish-skills``' paths, relative to the OpenRig checkout
(``skills/_canonical/...``, ``packages/daemon/assets/plugins/...``). A path is tried under
``--root`` first and falls back to ``--library-root``; the root a finding resolved against (or
both roots, when the file is missing from either) is named in the line.

It reports only: it sends no write, republishes nothing and touches no file. Each finding is one
indented line; a stale digest naming the skill and both hashes, a source path whose file is gone,
a divergent canonical/mirror pair, and a block that carries no provenance (an older skill) are
separate categories, and any finding exits 1.

Environment:
  AGENTHUB_URL    base URL of the 4genthub server, e.g. https://api.4genthub.com
  AGENTHUB_TOKEN  bearer token; sent as an Authorization header, never printed.

Usage:
  openrig_team_setup.py apply [--dry-run] [--team DIR]
  openrig_team_setup.py import-project [--dry-run] [--version X.Y.Z]
  openrig_team_setup.py publish-skills [--dry-run] [--inventory FILE] [--source-root DIR] [--version X.Y.Z]
  openrig_team_setup.py drift-check [--root DIR] [--library-root DIR]

``apply --dry-run`` prints the plan without calling the API and needs no environment.
``import-project --dry-run`` reports each module's SKIP / PUSH / NEW-VERSION outcome: it
reads the stored versions (a read-only ``GET``) when ``AGENTHUB_URL`` and
``AGENTHUB_TOKEN`` are set, and otherwise prints each module's conditional outcome
without any request.
``drift-check`` needs ``AGENTHUB_URL`` and ``AGENTHUB_TOKEN`` and only reads; findings go
to stderr, one indented line each. ``--root`` is where ``import-project``'s paths live and
``--library-root`` where ``publish-skills``' paths live (see Environment).

Exit codes:
  0  success, and no drift found
  1  network or HTTP error, or drift-check found at least one finding
  2  usage or configuration error
