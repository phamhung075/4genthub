"""Per-seat permission policy for omp seats, written as each seat's own config.

OpenRig launches an omp seat in exactly one of two postures: ``yolo`` (every tool
call is approved) or ``always-ask``, which the managed runner auto-cancels, so that
seat can call no tool at all. Nothing in between exists on the OpenRig side
(``rig seat set-permissions`` refuses omp). So every seat runs ``yolo`` and the
restrictions live where omp enforces them: ``<seat state>/agent/config.yml``.

omp honours two controls in every approval mode, and both are used here:

* ``bash.patterns`` - ordered shell-command rules. ``allowCompoundCommands`` makes it
  evaluate each command of ``a && b`` and ``a; b`` on its own, so an anchored pattern
  such as ``git push*`` also catches ``cd x && git push``.
* ``tools.approval`` - a per-tool ``deny``, including the MCP tools (``mcp__<server>_<tool>``).

``mcp.startupTimeoutMs: 0`` is written too. omp waits 250 ms by default for MCP tools at
startup; the HTTPS agenthub server is slower than that, so without it a seat's first turns
run without the 4genthub tools.

THIS IS A GUARD RAIL AGAINST ACCIDENTS, NOT A SANDBOX. A seat that can write files or run
``eval`` can still do anything these rules block by another route. The rules encode what
the project already forbids in prose: only the principal pushes, nobody amends or
force-resets the shared tree, no seat touches production or kills the tmux server, and
rig lifecycle is the lead's.

Usage::

    openrig_seat_policy.py show SEAT --rig RIG        print one seat's config
    openrig_seat_policy.py apply --rig RIG [--check]  write every seat's config.yml; with
                                                      --check write nothing and exit 1 on drift

A running seat reads its config at start, so ``apply`` takes effect on the next launch.

def real_home() -> Path:

    OpenRig launches a seat with HOME set to the seat's own state directory
    (``/home/<user>/.openrig/state/omp/<rig>-<seat>@<rig>``), so ``Path.home()``,
    ``os.path.expanduser("~")`` and any read of ``$HOME`` all resolve there. A default built on
    them therefore appends the state root to itself, which is how the documented
    ``apply --rig RIG --check`` came to report every seat "no agent directory" and exit 2 while
    the policy was in fact applied.

    The passwd database answers for the user this process runs as, and that answer is the same
    inside a seat and out of one - which is the property a MACHINE-LEVEL default needs, since
    the state root is a machine-level location rather than a per-seat one. ``--state-root``
    stays the explicit override for any other layout.
