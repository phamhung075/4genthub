RESPONSE_INTERPRETATION_RULES = """
📏 RESPONSE ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

🚦 HEALTH CHECK THRESHOLDS:
• Healthy: status = "ok", all services operational
• Warning: status = "degraded", some services impacted (>80% operational)
• Critical: status = "critical", major services down (<50% operational)
• Down: status = "error", server not responding

🎛️ CAPABILITY FEATURE FLAGS:
• core_features: Essential system functions (must have all)
• security_features: Authentication and authorization capabilities
• monitoring_features: Observability and metrics collection
• integration_features: External system connectivity options

🔬 CONNECTION DIAGNOSTICS PATTERNS:
• Latency Issues: response_time > 1000ms indicates performance problems
• Connection Drops: error_rate > 5% suggests stability issues
• Resource Exhaustion: connection_count near max_connections
• Authentication Problems: auth_failures > 0 requires investigation

📊 STATUS METRIC ANALYSIS:
• Server Load: cpu_usage > 80% or memory_usage > 90% indicates stress
• Connection Pool: active_connections / max_connections > 0.8 is high usage
• Error Rates: error_count / total_requests > 0.01 needs attention
• Performance: avg_response_time trending up suggests degradation

MONITORING_PATTERNS = """
🔄 STANDARD MONITORING WORKFLOWS:

📍 STARTUP SEQUENCE:
1. health_check → Verify server is responsive
2. server_capabilities → Discover available features
3. status → Get baseline metrics
4. register_updates → Subscribe to real-time changes

⏰ PERIODIC HEALTH CHECKS:
• Frequency: Every 30 seconds for critical systems
• Pattern: health_check with include_details=false for efficiency
• Escalation: If 3 consecutive failures, switch to diagnostic mode

📈 PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
• Baseline: Capture initial status metrics
• Tracking: Monitor trends in response_time, error_rate, resource_usage
• Alerting: Trigger when metrics exceed thresholds for 5+ minutes
• Analysis: Use connection_health for deep diagnostics

🚨 ERROR DETECTION AND RECOVERY:
• Detection: Monitor error_count and error_types in status
• Diagnosis: Use connection_health with specific connection_id
• Recovery: Implement exponential backoff for retries
• Reporting: Log patterns for post-incident analysis
