Project Management Tool Description

This module contains the comprehensive documentation for the manage_project MCP tool.
Separated from the controller logic for better maintainability and organization.

üìÅ PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - Complete Project Lifecycle and Multi-Project Orchestration

‚≠ê WHAT IT DOES: Manages projects throughout their lifecycle with comprehensive CRUD operations, health monitoring, resource management, and cross-project coordination. Provides intelligent maintenance, agent assignment optimization, and multi-project prioritization.
üìã WHEN TO USE: Project creation, management, monitoring, maintenance, multi-project coordination, resource optimization, and organizational structure management.
üéØ CRITICAL FOR: Project lifecycle management, organizational hierarchy, resource allocation, cross-project learning, and enterprise-scale development coordination.

ü§ñ AI USAGE GUIDELINES:
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS list projects on startup to understand organizational context
‚Ä¢ USE health checks before critical operations to ensure system integrity
‚Ä¢ COORDINATE across projects using priority scores and context switching
‚Ä¢ OPTIMIZE agent assignments based on project workload and specialization
‚Ä¢ SHARE reusable patterns between projects through global context delegation

| Action                | Required Parameters  | Optional Parameters      | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| create                | name                | description, user_id     | Create new project with automatic context initialization |
| get                   | project_id OR name  |                         | Retrieve project details by ID or name           |
| list                  | (none)              |                         | List all projects with status and health info    |
| update                | project_id          | name, description       | Update project metadata and trigger sync         |
| project_health_check  | project_id          |                         | Comprehensive health analysis with metrics       |
| cleanup_obsolete      | project_id          | force                   | Remove obsolete tasks, files, and resources      |
| validate_integrity    | project_id          | force                   | Validate structure, dependencies, and consistency |
| rebalance_agents      | project_id          | force                   | Optimize agent assignments across task trees     |

üí° USAGE GUIDELINES:
‚Ä¢ Provide all required identifiers for each action (see table above)
‚Ä¢ Use either project_id OR name for 'get' action (not both)
‚Ä¢ Optional parameters can be omitted unless overriding defaults
‚Ä¢ The 'force' parameter bypasses safety checks for maintenance operations
‚Ä¢ All operations return detailed success/error status with actionable messages
‚Ä¢ Business logic is delegated to the project application facade

üîç AI DECISION TREES:

PROJECT CREATION WORKFLOW:
```
IF new_feature_request:
    1. List existing projects
    2. Check for similar projects
    IF no_similar_project:
        Create new project
        Initialize project context
        Assign initial agents
    ELSE:
        Use existing project
        Create new git branch
```

PROJECT HEALTH MONITORING:
```
IF starting_work_on_project:
    Run project_health_check
    IF health_issues_found:
        Address issues before continuing
        Run cleanup_obsolete if needed
    ELSE:
        Proceed with planned work
```

üõë ERROR HANDLING:
‚Ä¢ Missing required parameters return specific field validation errors
‚Ä¢ Duplicate project names are rejected with existing project information
‚Ä¢ Invalid UUIDs and non-existent projects return clear error messages
‚Ä¢ Maintenance operations provide safety warnings and require confirmation
‚Ä¢ All business logic errors are handled by the application layer facade
