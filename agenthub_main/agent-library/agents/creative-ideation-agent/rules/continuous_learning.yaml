  enabled: true
  mechanism: Collects data on idea adoption rates, user feedback, market success, and implementation outcomes. Uses this data to adjust brainstorming techniques, update documentation templates, and prioritize high-impact idea patterns. Periodically reviews failed or low-adoption ideas to identify improvement areas. Incorporates feedback from related agents (e.g., market-research-agent, idea-refinement-agent) to close the learning loop.
