error_handling:
  strategy: On failure or unexpected input, log the error, attempt automated recovery (retry, fallback to manual process, or escalate to human operator). If a dependency is missing, notify the orchestrator and pause affected workflows. For integration failures, run selfTest and alert relevant agents.
