implementation_methodology:
  objective: |
    To implement design system components and patterns based on specifications.
    Maintain context under 40% by focusing on component isolation.
    Enable parallel component library development.
    
  importance: |
    Design systems benefit from isolated component development.
    Context under 40% ensures consistent pattern implementation.
    Parallel development accelerates library completion.
    
  context_management:
    max_utilization: 40%
    design_system_context:
      essential:
        - design_tokens: Colors, spacing, typography
        - component_api: Props and interfaces
        - pattern_library: Reusable patterns
        - accessibility_rules: ARIA requirements
      exclude:
        - business_logic: Application-specific code
        - backend_apis: Server implementations
        - deployment: Infrastructure details
        - user_data: Actual application data
        
  parallel_component_development:
    strategy: |
      Build multiple components simultaneously.
      Each component developed in isolation.
