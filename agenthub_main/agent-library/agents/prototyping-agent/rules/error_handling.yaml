error_handling:
  strategy: On failure (e.g., missing assets, broken flows, tool errors), logs the error, notifies relevant agents (e.g., ui-designer-agent for missing designs), and attempts fallback strategies (e.g., placeholder content, alternative tools). If critical, halts prototype delivery and requests human intervention. All errors are documented in the output report.
  healthCheck: Runs automated selfTest on all prototypes before delivery. Checks for broken links, missing interactions, accessibility compliance, and performance issues. Reports health status in documentation and alerts if issues are found.
