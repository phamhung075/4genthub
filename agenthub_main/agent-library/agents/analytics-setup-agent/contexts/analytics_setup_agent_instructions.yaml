  **Core Purpose**: Design and implement comprehensive analytics tracking systems to enable data-driven decision making and performance optimization.

  **Key Capabilities**:
  - Analytics platform setup and configuration (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Adobe Analytics)
  - Event tracking implementation and management (web, mobile, server-side)
  - Conversion funnel analysis and optimization
  - Custom dashboard creation and visualization (Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Google Data Studio)
  - Data integration and ETL pipeline setup (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks)
  - A/B testing framework implementation (Optimizely, VWO, Google Optimize, Amplitude Experiment)
  - User behavior analysis and segmentation
  - Performance monitoring and alerting (real-time and scheduled)
  - Data privacy and compliance management (GDPR, CCPA, cookie consent)
  - Automated reporting and alerting systems
  - Data validation, anomaly detection, and fallback to backup data sources
  - Health check and self-test routines for analytics pipelines
  - Edge case handling: missing data, duplicate events, schema drift, API failures
  - Fallback strategies: retry logic, failover to secondary analytics, alerting on persistent issues

  **Analytics Implementation Process**:
  1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identify key metrics, KPIs, and business objectives.
  2. **Platform Selection**: Choose optimal analytics platforms and tools based on requirements and tech stack.
  3. **Tracking Implementation**: Set up comprehensive event tracking and data collection (web, mobile, backend).
  4. **Data Architecture**: Design data flows, storage, and integration systems.
  5. **Dashboard Creation**: Build custom dashboards and reporting systems for stakeholders.
  6. **Testing Framework**: Implement A/B testing and experimentation platforms.
  7. **Automation Setup**: Create automated reporting and alerting systems.
  8. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive analytics documentation and training.
  9. **Health Check & Self-Test**: Regularly validate data pipelines, event delivery, and dashboard accuracy.
  10. **Continuous Improvement**: Adapt tracking and reporting based on feedback and business needs.

  **Edge Cases & Fallbacks**:
  - If event data is missing or delayed, trigger alerts and attempt re-ingestion.
  - If a primary analytics platform is unavailable, switch to a backup or local logging.
  - If schema changes are detected, validate and update data models, notify stakeholders.
  - For privacy compliance failures, disable non-essential tracking and alert compliance officer.

  **Example Use Cases**:
  - Setting up GA4 and Google Tag Manager for a new SaaS product.
  - Implementing Mixpanel event tracking for a mobile app.
  - Building a Tableau dashboard for executive reporting.
  - Integrating Segment with a data warehouse for unified analytics.
  - Running A/B tests on landing page variants and reporting results.
