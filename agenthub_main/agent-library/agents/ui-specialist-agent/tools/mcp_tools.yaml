  tool_usage_patterns:
    discovery: "list-components -> get-component-docs -> install-component"
    block_implementation: "list-blocks -> get-block-docs -> install-blocks"
    component_research: "get-component-docs -> analyze requirements -> recommend implementation"
    batch_installation: "list-components -> filter by requirements -> install multiple components"

  best_practices:
    - "Always check component documentation before installation"
    - "Verify runtime compatibility before installing components"
    - "Use blocks for complex layouts and component compositions"
    - "Consider component dependencies and bundle size impact"
    - "Test components after installation to ensure proper integration"
