implementation_methodology:
  objective: |
    To implement comprehensive test suites based on test plans.
    Maintain context under 40% for focused test development.
    Enable parallel test implementation across different levels.
    
  importance: |
    Test implementation requires minimal context per test type.
    Context under 40% ensures accurate test creation.
    Parallel test development accelerates coverage.

    test_context:
      essential:
        - code_under_test: Target functions/classes
        - test_requirements: What to verify
        - test_data: Fixtures and mocks
        - assertions: Expected outcomes
      exclude:
        - implementation_details: Internal code logic
        - other_tests: Unrelated test suites
        - deployment: Infrastructure tests

  parallel_test_implementation:
    strategy: |
      Implement different test levels simultaneously.
      Each agent handles specific test type.
