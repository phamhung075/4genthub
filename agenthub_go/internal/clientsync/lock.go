//	                                 `status` renders as "not pulled". A DIRECTORY counts as absent
//	                                 because the Python's is_file() is false for one, and a stat that
//	                                 fails for any other reason is treated the same way, as is_file()
//	                                 swallows it.
//	unreadable, or invalid JSON   -> exit 2 with the Python's message shape ("cannot read lock file
//	                                 <path>: <cause>"). The cause is the Go error's own text, which is
//	                                 the one place the wording cannot match Python's verbatim.
//	hash or path absent or not a string -> exit 2 with the Python's "lock file <path> is malformed".
//
// The Python raises these as SyncError with EXIT_USAGE, so they arrive here as CodedError; callers read
// the code with clientcmd.CodeOf rather than deciding it again.
