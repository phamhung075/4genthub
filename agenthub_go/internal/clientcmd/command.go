// Package clientcmd is the CONTRACT between the agenthub-client dispatcher and every subcommand
// package. It exists so that the two implementation packages (clientsync and clientbridge) share one
// definition of what a subcommand is and how it reaches OpenRig, rather than each guessing at a type
// and turning a merge into a rewrite.
//
// The dispatcher is thin on purpose: it reads argv[0] and the first argument, resolves the rig tool
// ONCE for the commands that need it, and calls Run. Registering a subcommand means returning a
// Command from your package; it never means editing main.go, which is why this lives outside it.
