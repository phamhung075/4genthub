// Command agenthubclient is the single local client: one Go binary that replaces the Python bridge,
// the sync scripts and the shell feedback helper, and absorbs seatcheck under its own name.
//
// THIS FILE IS A THIN DISPATCHER, and it stays thin: it reads argv[0] and the first argument, resolves
// the rig tool ONCE for the commands that need it, and calls Run. Subcommand packages register
// themselves through internal/clientcmd; nothing here knows what a sync verb does.
//
// THREE RULES SHAPE THE WHOLE CLIENT (ONE-CLIENT.md, "Cross-platform rules"), and two of them are
// implemented in internal/clientcmd so every command inherits them:
//
//   - NO TMUX. Seat lifecycle goes through rig - `rig seat stop <seat>` (audited; kills only that
//     seat's tmux session), `rig seat launch <seat>`, `rig seat clean <seat>` - so the same code runs
//     wherever rig does. The Python client killed tmux sessions directly, which is what this client
//     must stop doing.
//   - NO SHELL STRINGS. Every external command is exec.Command with an argument list, in
//     clientcmd.Rig.Run - one home for it - because the quoting rules on Windows are not the Unix ones.
//   - NO SILENT DOWNGRADE. A command that needs something this machine does not have exits non-zero
//     with ONE message naming what is missing: clientcmd.RequireRig, or a verb refusing by name.
