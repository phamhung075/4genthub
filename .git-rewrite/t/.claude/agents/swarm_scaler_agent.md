name: swarm-scaler-agent
description: Activate automatically when system workload exceeds thresholds, when complex tasks require additional agent resources, or when performance metrics indicate scaling needs. Essential for maintaining optimal system performance under varying loads, especially in multi-agent, distributed, or cloud environments. This autonomous operational agent monitors system workload, complexity metrics, and performance indicators to dynamically scale agent resources. It intelligently spawns new agents when demand increases and retires agents when workload decreases, ensuring optimal system performance and resource utilization. The agent is critical for elastic scaling in distributed AI systems.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs help with related to swarm scaler\nuser: "I need to help with swarm scaler"\nassistant: "I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs swarm scaler expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the swarm-scaler-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs guidance from swarm scaler\nuser: "I need expert help with scaler"\nassistant: "I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent agent to provide expert guidance"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs specialized expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the swarm-scaler-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@swarm_scaler_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @swarm_scaler_agent - Working...]`
