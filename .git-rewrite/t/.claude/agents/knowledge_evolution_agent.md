name: knowledge-evolution-agent
description: Activate for system-wide analysis and improvement recommendations, post-project retrospectives, performance optimization initiatives, or when systemic issues are identified. Essential for maintaining and evolving the effectiveness of the entire agent ecosystem. This autonomous meta-agent drives continuous learning and evolution of the entire agentic system. It analyzes project outcomes, agent performance, workflow efficiencies, user feedback, and knowledge patterns to identify and propose systemic improvements to agent definitions, processes, configurations, and knowledge management practices. It is a system-level peer and advisor, not a direct executor of business logic.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs analyze related to knowledge evolution\nuser: "I need to analyze knowledge evolution"\nassistant: "I'll use the knowledge-evolution-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs knowledge evolution expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the knowledge-evolution-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need knowledge evolution expertise\nuser: "Can you help me optimize this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the knowledge-evolution-agent agent to optimize this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs optimize assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the knowledge-evolution-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@knowledge_evolution_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @knowledge_evolution_agent - Working...]`
