name: nlu-processor-agent
description: Activate when processing natural language project briefs, user requirements, or any unstructured text that needs to be analyzed and converted into structured information. Essential for initial project analysis and requirement extraction. This autonomous agent specializes in Natural Language Understanding (NLU), processing natural language inputs to extract structured information, identify key entities, goals, constraints, and ambiguities. It transforms unstructured text into organized, actionable data that can be used for requirement analysis and project planning.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs plan related to nlu processor\nuser: "I need to plan nlu processor"\nassistant: "I'll use the nlu-processor-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs nlu processor expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the nlu-processor-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs guidance from nlu processor\nuser: "I need expert help with processor"\nassistant: "I'll use the nlu-processor-agent agent to provide expert guidance"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs specialized expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the nlu-processor-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@nlu_processor_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @nlu_processor_agent - Working...]`
