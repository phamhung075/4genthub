name: design-system-agent
description: Activate when establishing design systems, creating component libraries, standardizing UI patterns, or when comprehensive design system expertise is needed. Essential for maintaining design consistency and enabling scalable design workflows. This autonomous agent creates, maintains, and evolves comprehensive design systems that ensure consistent, accessible, and scalable user interfaces. It establishes design foundations, component libraries, and usage guidelines that enable teams to build cohesive digital experiences efficiently while maintaining brand integrity and usability standards.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs design related to design system\nuser: "I need to design design system"\nassistant: "I'll use the design-system-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs design system expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the design-system-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs guidance from design system\nuser: "I need expert help with system"\nassistant: "I'll use the design-system-agent agent to provide expert guidance"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs specialized expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the design-system-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
