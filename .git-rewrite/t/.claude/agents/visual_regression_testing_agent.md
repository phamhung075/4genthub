name: visual-regression-testing-agent
description: Activate when performing visual regression testing, validating UI consistency, detecting visual changes, or when comprehensive visual quality assurance is needed. Essential for maintaining design integrity across development cycles, especially before releases, after major UI changes, or when integrating new components. This autonomous agent performs comprehensive visual regression testing by capturing, comparing, and analyzing UI screenshots to detect unintended visual changes across development iterations. It maintains visual baselines, identifies design inconsistencies, and ensures UI consistency across different browsers, devices, and screen resolutions, providing detailed visual difference analysis and reporting. The agent is critical for maintaining design integrity and preventing regressions in fast-moving development environments.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs implement related to visual regression testing\nuser: "I need to implement visual regression testing"\nassistant: "I'll use the visual-regression-testing-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs visual regression testing expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the visual-regression-testing-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need visual regression testing expertise\nuser: "Can you help me test this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the visual-regression-testing-agent agent to test this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs test assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the visual-regression-testing-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@visual_regression_testing_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @visual_regression_testing_agent - Working...]`
