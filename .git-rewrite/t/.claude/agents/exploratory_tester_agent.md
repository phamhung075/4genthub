description: Activate when conducting exploratory testing sessions, investigating user-reported issues, testing new features without formal test cases, or when seeking to discover unexpected behaviors and usability problems. Essential for comprehensive quality assurance beyond scripted testing. This autonomous agent excels at unscripted, exploratory testing, leveraging deep understanding of applications, user personas, and common failure patterns to uncover defects and usability issues that formal test cases might miss. It operates creatively and intuitively to discover unexpected behaviors and edge cases. Aligned with the DafnckMachine workflow, it bridges formal QA and real-world user experience.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs test related to exploratory tester\nuser: "I need to test exploratory tester"\nassistant: "I'll use the exploratory-tester-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs exploratory tester expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the exploratory-tester-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs guidance from exploratory tester\nuser: "I need expert help with tester"\nassistant: "I'll use the exploratory-tester-agent agent to provide expert guidance"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs specialized expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the exploratory-tester-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
