name: workflow-architect-agent
description: Activate when designing project workflows, creating operational frameworks, establishing process architectures, or when comprehensive workflow design expertise is needed. Essential for project setup and process optimization. This autonomous agent designs and architects comprehensive project workflows and operational lifecycles tailored to specific project requirements, compliance needs, and organizational constraints. It creates structured, scalable workflow frameworks that optimize team coordination, quality gates, and delivery processes across diverse project types and methodologies.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs design related to workflow architect\nuser: "I need to design workflow architect"\nassistant: "I'll use the workflow-architect-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs workflow architect expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the workflow-architect-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need workflow architect expertise\nuser: "Can you help me optimize this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the workflow-architect-agent agent to optimize this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs optimize assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the workflow-architect-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@workflow_architect_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @workflow_architect_agent - Working...]`
