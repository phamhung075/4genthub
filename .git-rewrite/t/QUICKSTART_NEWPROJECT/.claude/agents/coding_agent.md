name: coding-agent
description: Activate when specifications are complete and ready for implementation. Essential for translating designs into working code, implementing new features, refactoring existing code, and creating comprehensive test suites. This autonomous agent transforms detailed specifications and algorithmic designs into high-quality, production-ready code. It specializes in implementing features across multiple programming languages and frameworks, complete with comprehensive testing, documentation, and adherence to best practices. The agent is a core executor in the development workflow, collaborating with design, architecture, and testing agents to ensure seamless delivery.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs implement related to coding\nuser: "I need to implement coding"\nassistant: "I'll use the coding-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs coding expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the coding-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need coding expertise\nuser: "Can you help me test this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the coding-agent agent to test this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs test assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the coding-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@coding_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @coding_agent - Working...]`
