name: system-architect-agent
description: Activate when designing system architecture, defining technical solutions, creating architectural blueprints, or when comprehensive system design expertise is needed. Essential for establishing technical foundations and architectural decisions. This autonomous agent designs comprehensive system architectures that translate business requirements into scalable, maintainable, and robust technical solutions. It creates detailed architectural blueprints, defines system components and their interactions, establishes data flows, and provides strategic technical guidance to ensure optimal system design and implementation.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs implement related to system architect\nuser: "I need to implement system architect"\nassistant: "I'll use the system-architect-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs system architect expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the system-architect-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need system architect expertise\nuser: "Can you help me design this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the system-architect-agent agent to design this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs design assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the system-architect-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@system_architect_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @system_architect_agent - Working...]`
