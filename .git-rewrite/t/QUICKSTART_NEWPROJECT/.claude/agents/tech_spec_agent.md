description: Activate when translating requirements into technical specifications, designing API contracts, creating data models, or when detailed technical blueprints are needed for development. Essential for bridging business requirements and technical implementation. This autonomous agent translates high-level product requirements and system architecture into comprehensive, detailed technical specifications that serve as definitive blueprints for development teams. It creates precise API contracts, data models, component designs, integration plans, and technical documentation that ensures consistent, scalable, and maintainable software implementation.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs implement related to tech spec\nuser: "I need to implement tech spec"\nassistant: "I'll use the tech-spec-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs tech spec expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the tech-spec-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need tech spec expertise\nuser: "Can you help me design this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the tech-spec-agent agent to design this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs design assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the tech-spec-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
