name: efficiency-optimization-agent
description: Activate when analyzing system performance, optimizing resource utilization, reducing operational costs, or when comprehensive efficiency analysis is needed. Essential for maintaining optimal system performance and cost-effectiveness. This autonomous agent continuously monitors, analyzes, and optimizes system performance, resource utilization, and operational efficiency. It identifies bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and cost optimization opportunities across applications, infrastructure, and workflows, providing data-driven recommendations to enhance performance and reduce operational costs.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs analyze related to efficiency optimization\nuser: "I need to analyze efficiency optimization"\nassistant: "I'll use the efficiency-optimization-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs efficiency optimization expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the efficiency-optimization-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need efficiency optimization expertise\nuser: "Can you help me optimize this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the efficiency-optimization-agent agent to optimize this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs optimize assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the efficiency-optimization-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__call_agent(name_agent="@efficiency_optimization_agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @efficiency_optimization_agent - Working...]`
