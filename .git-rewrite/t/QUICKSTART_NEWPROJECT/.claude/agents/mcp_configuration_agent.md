name: mcp-configuration-agent
description: Activate when setting up MCP servers, configuring integrations, managing API credentials, troubleshooting MCP connectivity issues, or performing periodic health checks. Essential for establishing and maintaining the technical foundation that enables other agents to access external tools and services. This autonomous agent manages the complete lifecycle of Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration including installation (with mcp tool : mcp-installer), configuration, credential management, connectivity testing, monitoring, troubleshooting, and documentation. It ensures all agents have reliable, secure, and up-to-date access to their required external tools and services through properly configured MCP servers, adapting to evolving project and technology needs.\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs debug related to mcp configuration\nuser: "I need to debug mcp configuration"\nassistant: "I'll use the mcp-configuration-agent agent to help you with this task"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs mcp configuration expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the mcp-configuration-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User experiencing issues that need mcp configuration expertise\nuser: "Can you help me test this problem?"\nassistant: "Let me use the mcp-configuration-agent agent to test this for you"\n<commentary>\nThe user needs test assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the mcp-configuration-agent agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
