# MCP Tools Testing Report
Date: 2025-02-08
Status: CRITICAL ISSUE - All MCP tools unavailable

## Executive Summary
During testing of the dhafnck_mcp_http tools, we discovered that ALL MCP tools have become unavailable after recent changes. This is a critical blocker preventing any testing of the task management system.

## Issue #1: Complete Loss of MCP Tools
### Description
All `mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__*` tools are missing from the available tools list. This includes:
- manage_task
- manage_project  
- manage_git_branch
- manage_subtask
- manage_context
- manage_context
- manage_agent
- manage_connection (this one still works)
- All other MCP tools

### Symptoms
1. Tools appear as "No such tool available" when invoked
2. Server health check shows healthy status
3. HTTP API endpoints respond but MCP tools not registered
4. Docker containers are running normally

### Investigation Results
- Server Status: ✅ Healthy (version 2.1.0)
- Docker Containers: ✅ Running (dhafnck-mcp-server, dhafnck-frontend)
- HTTP Endpoints: ✅ Responding (/health endpoint works)
- MCP Configuration: ✅ Correctly configured in .mcp.json
- MCP Tools Registration: ❌ FAILED - No tools available

### Root Cause Analysis
The MCP tools are not being registered with the MCP server. Possible causes:
1. Recent code changes broke the tool registration
2. FastMCP server initialization issue
3. Tool definitions not being loaded
4. MCP HTTP bridge not properly exposing tools

### Impact
- Complete inability to test task management system
- Cannot create, update, or manage tasks/projects/branches
- Cannot test context management
- Cannot test agent orchestration
- All planned tests are blocked

## Testing Progress

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Project Management | ❌ Blocked | No manage_project tool available |
| Git Branch Management | ❌ Blocked | No manage_git_branch tool available |
| Task Management | ❌ Blocked | No manage_task tool available |
| Subtask Management | ❌ Blocked | No manage_subtask tool available |
| Context Management | ❌ Blocked | No manage_context/manage_context tools |
| Agent Management | ❌ Blocked | No manage_agent tool available |
| Connection Management | ✅ Partial | Only manage_connection tool works |

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Verified server health - Server is healthy
2. ✅ Checked Docker containers - All running
3. ✅ Tested HTTP endpoints - Basic endpoints work
4. ✅ Reviewed MCP configuration - Correctly configured
5. ❌ Accessed MCP tools - Tools not available

## Investigation Findings

### Code Analysis Results
1. **mcp_entry_point.py**: 
   - Line 282-288: Attempts to import and register DDD-compliant tools
   - Import path: `from fastmcp.task_management.interface.ddd_compliant_mcp_tools import DDDCompliantMCPTools`
   - File exists at correct location
   - Import works when tested in container

2. **ddd_compliant_mcp_tools.py**:
   - Line 272-321: `register_tools()` method exists and registers multiple tool categories
   - Registers: task, subtask, context, project, git_branch, agent, cursor_rules, compliance tools
   - Vision System tools also registered if enabled

3. **consolidated_mcp_server.py**:
   - Line 30-31: Creates DDDCompliantMCPTools instance and registers tools
   - Used as alternative entry point

4. **Container Environment**:
   - Server files present in `/app/src/fastmcp/server/`
   - Import paths work correctly inside container
   - Server reports healthy status

### Likely Root Cause
The MCP HTTP bridge is not properly exposing the registered FastMCP tools through the JSON-RPC protocol. The tools are being registered internally but not made available through the MCP HTTP interface at `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`.

## Required Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix MCP HTTP bridge to expose registered tools
2. Check if FastMCP's HTTP adapter is correctly configured
3. Verify JSON-RPC endpoint is properly routing to tool handlers
4. Test that tools/list method returns registered tools
5. Ensure Accept header requirements are properly handled

## Fix Prompts for New Chat

### Prompt #1: Fix Missing MCP Tools Registration
```
CRITICAL ISSUE: All MCP tools have disappeared and are not available through the mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__ prefix.

Context:
- Server is running and healthy (version 2.1.0)
- Docker containers are up and running
- HTTP endpoints respond correctly (/health works)
- MCP configuration in .mcp.json is correct
- But ALL MCP tools show "No such tool available" error

Symptoms:
- Cannot access any mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__* tools
- manage_task, manage_project, manage_git_branch, etc. all missing
- Only manage_connection seems to partially work

Investigation shows:
- Server health check: {"status":"healthy","version":"2.1.0"}
- MCP HTTP bridge configured at: http://localhost:8000/mcp/
- But tools/list returns empty or errors

Please investigate and fix:
1. Check src/fastmcp/server/mcp_entry_point.py for tool registration
2. Verify consolidated_mcp_server.py is properly registering tools
3. Check if MCP HTTP bridge is correctly exposing FastMCP tools
4. Review any recent changes that might have broken tool registration
5. Ensure all controller tools are being added to the server

The entire task management system is non-functional without these tools.
```

### Prompt #2: Restore MCP Tool Definitions
```
The dhafnck_mcp_http server is running but not exposing any MCP tools.

Check these specific files for issues:
- src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/consolidated_mcp_server.py
- src/fastmcp/server/mcp_entry_point.py
- src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/*_mcp_controller.py

The server should expose these tools with mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__ prefix:
- manage_task
- manage_project
- manage_git_branch
- manage_subtask
- manage_context
- manage_context
- manage_agent
- manage_connection
- manage_compliance
- manage_delegation_queue
- And many others

Please trace through the initialization flow and identify why tools are not being registered with the MCP server.
```

### Prompt #3: Debug MCP HTTP Bridge
```
The MCP HTTP bridge at http://localhost:8000/mcp/ is not exposing FastMCP tools.

When calling the JSON-RPC endpoint:
POST http://localhost:8000/mcp
Headers: Accept: application/json, text/event-stream
Body: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","params":{},"id":1}

The response is either empty or errors out, indicating no tools are registered.

Please:
1. Check how FastMCP HTTP adapter works
2. Verify the /mcp endpoint is correctly configured
3. Test the JSON-RPC protocol implementation
4. Ensure tools are being exposed through the HTTP bridge
5. Fix the registration/exposure of MCP tools

This is blocking all testing of the task management system.
```

### Prompt #4: Verify Tool Registration Flow
```
The dhafnck_mcp_http server is running but MCP tools are not accessible through the expected mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__ prefix.

Please trace the complete tool registration flow:
1. Start at mcp_entry_point.py line 282-288 where DDDCompliantMCPTools is imported and registered
2. Follow through ddd_compliant_mcp_tools.py register_tools() method (line 272-321)
3. Check how FastMCP exposes tools through its HTTP interface
4. Verify the MCP HTTP bridge at http://localhost:8000/mcp/ is configured correctly
5. Test that the JSON-RPC tools/list method works

The server health check works but tools are not available. The issue appears to be in the HTTP bridge layer not exposing the internally registered tools.
```

## Conclusion
The complete loss of MCP tools is a critical issue that prevents any testing of the dhafnck_mcp system. Investigation shows:
- Tools are being registered in the code (ddd_compliant_mcp_tools.py)
- Server is healthy and running
- HTTP endpoints respond correctly
- But MCP tools are not exposed through the HTTP bridge

The issue is likely in the FastMCP HTTP adapter or JSON-RPC protocol implementation not properly exposing the registered tools to MCP clients.

## Next Steps
1. Use the fix prompts above in a new chat to resolve the MCP HTTP bridge issue
2. Once fixed, verify all tools are available with mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__ prefix
3. Resume testing from the beginning
4. Document the root cause and solution
5. Implement integration tests for MCP tool availability
