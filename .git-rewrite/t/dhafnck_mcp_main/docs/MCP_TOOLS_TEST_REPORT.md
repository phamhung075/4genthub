## Issues Encountered

### Issue #1: Agent Assignment UUID Format Error
**Location**: Git Branch Management - Agent Assignment
**Error**: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "@coding_agent"`
**Description**: When trying to assign an agent using the @agent_name format, the system expects a UUID but receives a string with @ prefix.

**Error Details**:
```
psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "@coding_agent"
LINE 3: WHERE agents.id = '@coding_agent'
```

**Workaround Applied**: 
1. Listed all agents using `manage_agent(action="list")`
2. Used the actual UUID (2d3727cf-6915-4b54-be8d-4a5a0311ca03) instead of @coding_agent

**Fix Prompt for Issue #1**:
```markdown
## Fix Required: Agent Assignment Should Accept Both UUID and @agent_name Format

### Problem Description:
The manage_git_branch action with assign_agent fails when using @agent_name format. The system only accepts UUID format, but the documentation and AI workflow suggest using @agent_name format.

### Current Behavior:
- Input: agent_id="@coding_agent"
- Error: PostgreSQL UUID validation fails

### Expected Behavior:
- System should accept both formats:
  - UUID: "2d3727cf-6915-4b54-be8d-4a5a0311ca03"
  - Name with @: "@coding_agent"
  - Name without @: "coding_agent"

### Suggested Fix:
1. In the git branch assignment logic, check if agent_id starts with @ or is not a valid UUID
2. If so, query agents table by name field instead of id
3. Use the found agent's UUID for the actual assignment

### Files Likely Needing Changes:
- Git branch service/controller handling agent assignment
- Agent repository query methods
- Input validation/transformation layer
```

### Issue #2: Context Auto-Creation Not Visible
**Location**: Task Creation and Updates
**Observation**: Tasks are created without automatic context creation, and context_id remains null even after updates.

**Details**:
- All created tasks have `context_id: null`
- No automatic context creation occurs during task creation
- Context must be manually created using manage_context

**Fix Prompt for Issue #2**:
```markdown
## Enhancement Required: Automatic Context Creation for Tasks

### Problem Description:
Tasks are created without automatic context initialization. The context_id field remains null, requiring manual context creation.

### Current Behavior:
- Task creation doesn't trigger context creation
- context_id remains null
- Manual context creation required

### Expected Behavior:
- Automatic context creation when task is created
- Context should inherit from branch/project context
- context_id should be populated automatically

### Suggested Implementation:
1. Add context creation logic in CreateTaskUseCase
2. Use task_id as context_id
3. Initialize with basic task metadata
4. Set up proper inheritance chain (Global â†’ Project â†’ Branch â†’ Task)

### Benefits:
- Reduces manual steps
- Ensures all tasks have context for knowledge capture
- Maintains consistency across the system
```

### Issue #3: Get Next Task Internal Error
**Location**: Task Management - Get Next Task
**Error**: `TypeError` causing internal error
**Description**: The get next task operation fails with an internal TypeError.

**Error Details**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "The next task retrieval could not be completed.",
  "error_code": "INTERNAL_ERROR",
  "technical_details": {
    "operation": "next task retrieval",
    "error_type": "TypeError"
  }
}
```

**Fix Prompt for Issue #3**:
```markdown
## Fix Required: Get Next Task Operation Failing with TypeError

### Problem Description:
The manage_task action with "next" fails with an internal TypeError. The operation cannot retrieve the next prioritized task.

### Current Behavior:
- Input: action="next", git_branch_id="valid-uuid", include_context=true
- Error: Internal TypeError during task retrieval

### Expected Behavior:
- Should return the highest priority task that is ready to work on
- Should consider dependencies and current status
- Should include context if requested

### Debugging Steps:
1. Check the next task algorithm for null/undefined handling
2. Verify dependency resolution logic
3. Check context inclusion logic for type mismatches
4. Review priority scoring calculation

### Likely Causes:
- Null reference in priority calculation
- Type mismatch in context retrieval
- Missing validation in dependency checking

### Files to Investigate:
- Next task use case/service
- Priority calculation logic
- Context enrichment for next task
```

## Performance Observations

1. **Response Times**: All operations completed within 1-2 seconds
2. **Workflow Guidance**: Comprehensive guidance provided with each operation
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Robust dependency tracking and blocking analysis
4. **Enrichment**: Vision system enrichment adds valuable context to responses

## Recommendations

1. **Agent Management**: Implement name-based agent lookup to support @agent_name format
2. **Context Management**: Enable automatic context creation for all entity creations
3. **Documentation**: Update docs to clarify UUID vs name usage for agents
4. **Error Messages**: Enhance error messages to suggest valid formats

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining test scenarios (4-7)
2. Test subtask management with TDD workflow
3. Verify task completion with context validation
4. Test hierarchical context inheritance
5. Document any additional issues found

## Test Environment Details
- Server: DhafnckMCP v2.1.0
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Authentication: MVP mode (disabled)
- Docker: Backend container rebuilt without cache

## Final Test Statistics

### Success Rate by Category:
- **Project Management**: 100% (6/6 operations)
- **Git Branch Management**: 83% (5/6 operations)
- **Task Management**: 86% (6/7 operations)
- **Subtask Management**: 100% (2/2 operations tested)
- **Task Completion**: 100% (1/1 operation)
- **Overall Success Rate**: 90% (20/22 operations)

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **Agent Assignment Format** - Workaround available
2. **Get Next Task TypeError** - Blocking feature
3. **Context Auto-Creation** - Working in completion, not in creation

### Positive Findings:
- Dependency tracking is robust and comprehensive
- Workflow guidance provides excellent AI assistance
- Task completion with auto-context creation works well
- Search functionality is accurate
- Subtask management is functional
- Project health checks provide valuable insights

## Conclusion

The DhafnckMCP v2.1.0 system is largely functional with a 90% success rate across all tested operations. The main issues are:
1. Agent assignment needs to support name-based lookup
2. Get next task feature has a critical bug that needs fixing
3. Context creation could be more consistent across all operations

The system provides excellent workflow guidance, comprehensive dependency tracking, and robust task management capabilities. With the identified issues fixed, the system would be fully production-ready.
