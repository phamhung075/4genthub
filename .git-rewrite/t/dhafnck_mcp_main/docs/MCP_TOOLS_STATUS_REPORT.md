# MCP Tools Status Report

## Current Status: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

The MCP server is running but the task management tools are not available through the MCP HTTP bridge.

## Working Components
- ✅ Docker container is running (dhafnck-mcp-server)
- ✅ HTTP server is responding (http://localhost:8000/health)
- ✅ manage_connection tool is available and working
- ✅ Server version: 2.1.0

## Non-Functional Components
- ❌ All task management tools (manage_task, manage_project, manage_git_branch, etc.)
- ❌ Context management tools (manage_context, manage_context)
- ❌ Agent management tools (manage_agent, call_agent)
- ❌ Rule management tools (manage_rule)

## Root Cause
The system has been configured to ONLY use Supabase PostgreSQL database, with SQLite permanently disabled. 
The DDDCompliantMCPTools class fails to initialize because:
1. DATABASE_TYPE is set to "supabase" but no Supabase credentials are provided
2. The database initialization fails with "SUPABASE NOT PROPERLY CONFIGURED" error
3. This prevents the task management tools from being registered with the MCP server

## Required Configuration
To make the tools work, you need to either:

### Option 1: Configure Supabase (Recommended by system design)
Set the following environment variables in your .env file:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:[port]/postgres
# OR provide individual components:
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
SUPABASE_DB_HOST=your_supabase_host
SUPABASE_DB_PORT=5432
SUPABASE_DB_NAME=postgres
SUPABASE_DB_USER=postgres
```

### Option 2: Use PostgreSQL directly
Set DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql and provide DATABASE_URL:
```env
DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dhafnck_mcp
```

## System Design Decision
The system has been intentionally designed to:
- Reject SQLite completely (raises ValueError if DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite)
- Require either Supabase or PostgreSQL for production use
- Not fallback to any alternative if database is not configured

## Files Involved
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/database/database_config.py` - Enforces Supabase/PostgreSQL only
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/ddd_compliant_mcp_tools.py` - Fails to initialize without database
- `/src/fastmcp/server/mcp_entry_point.py` - Registers tools but fails silently if DDDCompliantMCPTools fails
- `/scripts/init_database.py` - Deprecated and disabled for SQLite

## Impact
Without a configured database, the entire task management system is non-functional. Only the basic connection management tool works.

## Temporary Workaround Attempted
I attempted to make the tools work without a database by:
1. Making DDDCompliantMCPTools handle database initialization failure gracefully
2. Allowing the init_database.py script to succeed with warnings instead of failing

However, this only allowed the server to start - the tools still require a database to function properly.

## Recommendation
To use the task management system, you MUST configure either Supabase or PostgreSQL. The system will not work without a properly configured database as per the architectural decision to remove SQLite support.

## Note on System Integrity
I have restored all files to their original state as per your system design:
- SQLite remains permanently disabled
- Supabase is the default and recommended database
- No fallback options are available
- The system enforces these constraints strictly

This is by design to ensure data integrity, concurrent access support, and production-ready performance.
