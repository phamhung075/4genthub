## ❌ Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Context Creation UUID Error
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** manage_context (Hierarchical Context System)  
**Error:** 
```
(psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type uuid: "global_singleton"
```
**Root Cause:** The parent_global_id field expects a UUID but receives the string 'global_singleton'  
**Impact:** Cannot create project-level or branch-level contexts due to foreign key constraint failures  

### Issue #2: Agent Assignment String vs UUID
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Component:** manage_git_branch (Agent Assignment)  
**Error:**
```  
invalid input syntax for type uuid: "@security_auditor_agent"
```
**Root Cause:** Agent assignment expects UUID but receives string agent names  
**Workaround:** Must register agents first to get UUID, then use UUID for assignment  
**Impact:** User experience friction - requires extra step to register agents before assignment

### Issue #3: Context Hierarchy Dependencies  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Component:** manage_context (Branch Context Creation)  
**Error:** `Parent project context '07b5c53f-a401-442e-92cc-e74504a209e4' does not exist`  
**Root Cause:** 4-tier hierarchy (Global → Project → Branch → Task) requires contexts to be created in order  
**Impact:** Cannot create branch contexts without first creating parent project contexts

### Issue #4: Task Completion Runtime Error
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** manage_task (Task Completion)  
**Error:** `cannot access local variable 'TaskUpdated' where it is not associated with a value`  
**Root Cause:** Variable scoping issue in task completion logic  
**Impact:** Cannot complete tasks - blocking workflow progression

## Fix Prompts for Each Issue

### Fix Prompt #1: Context Creation UUID Error
**Issue:** Context creation fails with UUID error for parent_global_id  
**Priority:** HIGH  

**Detailed Fix Prompt for New Chat:**
```
Fix context creation UUID error in hierarchical context system:

PROBLEM:
- Context creation fails with error: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "global_singleton"
- The parent_global_id field in project_contexts table expects UUID but receives string 'global_singleton'
- This breaks the entire hierarchical context system (Global → Project → Branch → Task)

FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
- src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/orm/unified_context_repository.py
- src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/database/models/context_models.py
- database schema for project_contexts table parent_global_id column

SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. Check if global context should use actual UUID instead of 'global_singleton' string
2. Update database schema to allow string IDs OR update code to use UUIDs consistently
3. Ensure hierarchical context creation follows proper UUID format
4. Add migration if database changes needed

TEST CASE:
- Create global context → should succeed
- Create project context for existing project → should succeed without UUID error
- Verify full hierarchy: Global → Project → Branch → Task

Please fix this critical context system error.
```

### Fix Prompt #2: Task Completion Runtime Error  
**Issue:** Task completion fails with 'TaskUpdated' variable error  
**Priority:** HIGH  

**Detailed Fix Prompt for New Chat:**
```
Fix task completion runtime error in manage_task tool:

PROBLEM:
- Task completion fails with error: "cannot access local variable 'TaskUpdated' where it is not associated with a value"
- This is a variable scoping issue preventing task completion workflow
- Completely blocks users from completing tasks

FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
- src/fastmcp/task_management/application/use_cases/complete_task.py
- src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/task_mcp_controller.py
- Any file handling task completion logic with 'TaskUpdated' variable

SOLUTION APPROACH:  
1. Find where 'TaskUpdated' variable is referenced without being defined
2. Check for missing imports or incorrect variable scoping
3. Ensure proper variable initialization before use
4. Add proper error handling for task completion edge cases

TEST CASE:
- Create a task
- Try to complete it with: manage_task(action="complete", task_id="...", completion_summary="Test completion")
- Should complete successfully without runtime errors

This is critical - users cannot complete their work without this fix.
```

### Fix Prompt #3: Agent Assignment UX Improvement
**Issue:** Agent assignment requires UUID, not string name  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  

**Detailed Fix Prompt for New Chat:**
```
Improve agent assignment UX in git branch management:

PROBLEM:
- Users expect to assign agents by name (e.g., "@security_auditor_agent") 
- System requires UUID, causing error: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "@security_auditor_agent"
- Forces users to register agents first to get UUID, then use UUID for assignment
- Poor user experience - should accept agent names directly

FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
- src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/git_branch_mcp_controller.py  
- src/fastmcp/task_management/application/use_cases/assign_agent_to_branch.py
- Agent lookup and resolution logic

SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. Add agent name-to-UUID resolution in assignment logic
2. If agent name provided, look up UUID automatically  
3. If agent doesn't exist, auto-register with provided name
4. Maintain backward compatibility with UUID assignments

ENHANCED UX:
- Allow: manage_git_branch(action="assign_agent", agent_id="@security_auditor_agent")
- Should auto-resolve to UUID internally
- Should auto-register agent if not exists
- Should provide clear feedback about what happened

This improves developer experience significantly.
```

### Fix Prompt #4: Context Hierarchy Auto-Creation
**Issue:** Branch context creation requires parent project context to exist first  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  

**Detailed Fix Prompt for New Chat:**
```
Implement auto-creation for context hierarchy dependencies:

PROBLEM:
- Branch context creation fails with: "Parent project context does not exist"
- 4-tier hierarchy (Global → Project → Branch → Task) requires manual creation in order
- Users must create contexts in sequence, causing friction
- Should auto-create missing parent contexts

FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
- src/fastmcp/task_management/application/services/unified_context_service.py
- src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/unified_context_controller.py
- Context creation and hierarchy validation logic

SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. When creating branch context, check if project context exists
2. If project context missing, auto-create it with basic project metadata
3. Ensure global context exists (create if needed)  
4. Make context creation atomic - all levels created in single transaction
5. Add logging for auto-created contexts

ENHANCED FLOW:
- User creates branch context directly
- System auto-creates: Global → Project → Branch contexts as needed
- Clear feedback about which contexts were auto-created
- Maintain data integrity with proper parent-child relationships

This eliminates context creation friction and improves UX.
