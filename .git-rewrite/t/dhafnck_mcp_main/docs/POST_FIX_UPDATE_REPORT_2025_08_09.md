# Post-Fix Update Report - Backend Rebuild with Supabase Integration
## Date: 2025-08-09
## Summary: Complete backend rebuild with no-cache and Supabase database integration

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Successfully rebuild the DhafnckMCP backend with fresh dependencies and migrate to Supabase PostgreSQL cloud database as requested by the user.

### ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

#### 1. Backend Docker Image Rebuild
- **Action**: Rebuilt backend Docker image using `--no-cache` flag
- **Result**: Successfully created fresh image `dhafnck-mcp-server:latest` (708MB)
- **Impact**: All Python dependencies refreshed and updated to latest compatible versions
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 2. Supabase Database Integration
- **Action**: Configured backend to use Supabase PostgreSQL cloud database from .env credentials
- **Database**: Connected to aws-0-eu-north-1.pooler.supabase.com with SSL-enabled production database
- **Configuration**: Used existing .env file with valid Supabase credentials
- **Container**: Backend running with (healthy) status indicating successful database connection
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 3. Frontend Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: N+1 query problem causing slow loading with multiple projects (10 sequential API calls)
- **Solution**: Implemented parallel branch fetching using Promise.all instead of sequential getProject calls
- **Implementation**: Modified listProjects function in dhafnck-frontend/src/api.ts
- **Performance**: Reduced 10 sequential calls to parallel execution for 9 projects
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4. System Container Management
- **Action**: Cleaned up redundant containers as requested
- **Removed**: dhafnck-frontend container (port 3000)
- **Kept**: 
  - dhafnck-backend-supabase-final (port 8000) - HEALTHY
  - dhafnck-frontend-3800 (port 3800) - RUNNING
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
