#### Context Management (Partial)
- ✅ **List Context**: Lists contexts at specified levels

### ❌ Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Task Creation Failure
**Issue**: Cannot create tasks due to user_id validation error
- **Error**: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "compatibility-default-user"`
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Cannot create any new tasks
- **Root Cause**: The system is using `"compatibility-default-user"` as a user_id, but the database expects a UUID
- **Affected Actions**:
  - `manage_task` action: `create`
  - All task creation attempts fail with same error

#### 2. Task Operations Failures
**Issue**: Multiple task operations fail due to user_id or missing task issues
- **Get Task**: Returns "Task not found" even for tasks that appear in list
- **Update Task**: Cannot update tasks - "Task not found"
- **Search Tasks**: Fails with user_id UUID validation error
- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Cannot interact with tasks properly

#### 3. Subtask Creation Failure
**Issue**: Cannot create subtasks
- **Error**: Task not found when trying to create subtask
- **Impact**: HIGH - Subtask management not functional

#### 4. Context Management Issues
**Issue**: Context creation and retrieval have multiple problems
- **Global Context Creation**: Fails with "badly formed hexadecimal UUID string" when using "global_singleton"
- **Project Context Creation**: Fails with "Global context is required before creating project contexts"
- **Get Context**: Returns "Context not found" for existing projects
- **Impact**: HIGH - Context management system not functioning properly

## Detailed Issue Analysis

### Issue #1: User ID UUID Validation Error

**Error Details**:
```
psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "compatibility-default-user"
```

**Occurrence Pattern**:
- Occurs in all task creation attempts
- Occurs in task search operations
- The system is defaulting to `"compatibility-default-user"` as user_id
- Database schema expects user_id to be a valid UUID

**Technical Analysis**:
- The backend is using a string placeholder instead of a valid UUID for default user
- This affects the entire task management system
- The issue is in the backend code, not the MCP tool calls

### Issue #2: Task Visibility and Access

**Symptoms**:
- Tasks appear in `list` action but cannot be accessed via `get` or `update`
- This suggests a potential user isolation issue where tasks are filtered by user_id

**Possible Causes**:
1. User isolation is too strict
2. Default user context not properly set
3. Task retrieval queries filtering by incorrect user_id

### Issue #3: Context Hierarchy Problems

**Issues Found**:
1. Cannot create global context with "global_singleton" identifier
2. Project contexts require global context but global cannot be created
3. Existing projects don't have contexts automatically created
4. Context retrieval fails even for existing projects

**Impact**:
- The 4-tier context hierarchy (Global → Project → Branch → Task) is broken
- Cannot leverage context inheritance
- Frontend visibility features won't work without contexts

## Recommendations for Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix User ID Issue
The system needs to use a valid UUID for the default user instead of "compatibility-default-user"

### Priority 2: Fix Context Creation
- Allow "global_singleton" as a valid context_id for global level
- Auto-create contexts when projects/branches/tasks are created
- Fix context retrieval to work with existing entities

### Priority 3: Fix Task Access
- Ensure tasks can be accessed regardless of user_id for testing
- Fix the disconnect between list and get/update operations

## Test Execution Details

### Successful Tests
1. Created 2 new projects successfully
2. Created 2 git branches in project
3. Registered and assigned agent to branch
4. Updated project and branch descriptions
5. Listed projects and branches with full details

### Failed Tests
1. ❌ Could not create any tasks (5 on first branch, 2 on second branch)
2. ❌ Could not update, get, or search existing tasks
3. ❌ Could not create subtasks
4. ❌ Could not create or retrieve contexts
5. ❌ Could not complete tasks

## Next Steps
1. Fix the user_id UUID issue in the backend
2. Fix context management system
3. Re-test all failed operations
4. Implement proper user management or remove user isolation for testing

## Fix Prompts for Each Issue

### Fix Prompt 1: User ID UUID Validation Error

**Title**: Fix "compatibility-default-user" UUID validation error in task operations

**Problem**: 
The task management system is failing because it's using "compatibility-default-user" as a user_id, but the PostgreSQL database expects a valid UUID. This affects task creation, search, and all user-scoped operations.

**Error Message**:
```
psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "compatibility-default-user"
```

**Files to Check**:
- Task creation logic in TaskApplicationFacade
- User authentication middleware
- Default user configuration
- Database schema for tasks table

**Fix Required**:
1. Replace "compatibility-default-user" with a valid UUID (e.g., "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001")
2. Or modify the user_id column to accept strings
3. Or implement proper user UUID generation in the authentication layer

**Test Command After Fix**:
```python
mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_task(
    action="create",
    git_branch_id="[valid-branch-id]",
    title="Test Task",
    description="Testing task creation after fix"
)
```

### Fix Prompt 2: Task Visibility and Access Issues

**Title**: Fix task retrieval - tasks visible in list but not accessible via get/update

**Problem**:
Tasks appear in the list action but return "Task not found" when trying to get or update them. This suggests user isolation is preventing access to tasks.

**Symptoms**:
- `manage_task(action="list")` shows tasks
- `manage_task(action="get", task_id="[id]")` returns "not found"
- `manage_task(action="update", task_id="[id]")` returns "not found"

**Possible Causes**:
1. User isolation filtering in get/update but not in list
2. Incorrect user context in queries
3. Missing user_id parameter handling

**Fix Required**:
1. Ensure consistent user filtering across all task operations
2. Add optional bypass for user isolation in testing mode
3. Fix user context propagation in task queries

---

### Fix Prompt 3: Context Management System Broken

**Title**: Fix context creation and retrieval for 4-tier hierarchy

**Problems**:
1. Cannot create global context with "global_singleton" - gets "badly formed hexadecimal UUID string"
2. Cannot create project context - requires global context first
3. Cannot retrieve contexts for existing projects
4. No auto-creation of contexts when entities are created

**Specific Errors**:
- Global: "badly formed hexadecimal UUID string" when using "global_singleton"
- Project: "Global context is required before creating project contexts"
- Get: "Context not found" for existing project IDs

**Fix Required**:
1. Allow "global_singleton" as a special case for global context_id
2. Auto-create global context if it doesn't exist
3. Auto-create contexts when projects/branches/tasks are created
4. Fix context retrieval to work with existing entities

**Test Commands After Fix**:
```python
# Should work with "global_singleton"
mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_context(
    action="create",
    level="global",
    context_id="global_singleton",
    data={"organization": "Test"}
)

# Should auto-create or retrieve existing
mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_context(
    action="get",
    level="project",
    context_id="[existing-project-id]"
)
```

---

### Fix Prompt 4: Subtask Creation Failures

**Title**: Fix subtask creation - parent task not found

**Problem**:
Cannot create subtasks even for tasks that appear in the task list. The error is "Task [id] not found" when the task clearly exists.

**Root Cause**:
Likely related to the user_id issue - subtask creation is trying to find parent task with user filtering.

**Fix Required**:
1. Fix user_id handling in subtask creation
2. Ensure parent task lookup doesn't fail due to user isolation
3. Add proper error messages to distinguish between "not found" and "access denied"

---

### Fix Prompt 5: Task Search Functionality Broken

**Title**: Fix task search - fails with user_id UUID validation

**Problem**:
Task search fails with the same user_id UUID validation error, preventing any search functionality.

**Fix Required**:
1. Fix user_id handling in search queries
2. Make user_id optional for search operations
3. Add proper default UUID for compatibility mode
