# Database Schema Fix - Complete Summary

## âœ… Fix Status: COMPLETE

### What Was Fixed
1. **ORM Model Synchronization** - All context models now match Supabase schema exactly
2. **UUID Type Consistency** - All context tables recreated with UUID for all ID fields
3. **Foreign Key Relationships** - Proper relationships established between all context levels
4. **Docker Rebuild Process** - Enhanced docker-menu.sh ensures clean rebuilds

### Tests Passed
âœ… Global context operations working
âœ… Project context operations working  
âœ… Branch context operations working
âœ… Task context operations working
âœ… Relationship navigation working

### How to Rebuild Your System

#### Option 1: Quick Rebuild (Recommended)
```bash
./docker-system/docker-menu.sh
# Select option 2 (Supabase Cloud)
```

#### Option 2: Force Complete Rebuild (If Issues)
```bash
./docker-system/docker-menu.sh
# Select option 10 (Force Complete Rebuild)
# Then select option 2 (Supabase Cloud)
```

### Documentation Created
- âœ… CHANGELOG.md updated with all fixes
- âœ… Issue documentation: `/docs/issues/2025-01-13-database-schema-mismatch.md`
- âœ… Integration tests: `/src/tests/integration/test_context_operations.py`
- âœ… Fix guide: `SUPABASE_FIX_GUIDE.md`

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. ORM Models (`src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/database/models.py`)
- GlobalContext: UUID primary key, proper organization_id
- ProjectContext: 'id' as primary key (not 'project_id')
- BranchContext: 'id' as primary key, removed non-existent columns
- TaskContext: 'id' as primary key, proper foreign keys
- All relationships: Added explicit primaryjoin conditions

#### 2. Database Tables (Supabase)
All context tables recreated with:
- UUID for ALL id fields
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Consistent column types
- Default values for JSON fields

#### 3. Docker Menu (`docker-system/docker-menu.sh`)
- Added Python cache clearing
- Added force complete rebuild (option 10)
- Added container cleanup before rebuild
- Enhanced Supabase verification

### Your Supabase Data
- âœ… Project data preserved (only context tables were recreated)
- âœ… Tasks, subtasks, agents all intact
- âœ… Connection now working properly

### Next Steps
1. Use docker-menu.sh for all rebuilds
2. Monitor for any new issues
3. Report any problems to GitHub issues

## System is now fully operational with Supabase! ðŸŽ‰
