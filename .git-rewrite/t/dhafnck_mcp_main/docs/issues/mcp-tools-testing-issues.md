# MCP Tools Testing Issues Report

## Date: 2025-08-20
## Testing Environment: dhafnck_mcp_http
## Status: FULLY RESOLVED (2025-08-20)

### Fixes Applied:
✅ User context integration - Controllers now retrieve and normalize user IDs
✅ Project creation - Works with normalized UUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)
✅ Task creation - Fixed by normalizing user_id in all facade factories
✅ Agent registration - Fixed by updating agent repository factory to use normalized UUIDs
✅ Global context - Fixed by removing user_id field and handling organization_id as UUID

## Issue 1: Projects Not Visible in Frontend Despite Successful Backend Creation

### Problem Description
Projects created via MCP tools are successfully stored in the database but are not visible in the frontend when using authenticated user tokens. The projects are being created with `user_id = 'default_id'` instead of the actual authenticated user's ID.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Hard-coded Default User ID**: Throughout the codebase, `user_id` defaults to `'default_id'` in multiple locations:
   - Project controllers: `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/project_mcp_controller.py` (lines 102-103)
   - Repository factories: Multiple files default to `'default_id'`
   - Application facades: Default to `'default_id'` when user context is missing

2. **Missing User Context Integration**: The MCP tools are not retrieving the authenticated user context from the JWT token. While the authentication middleware (`UserContextMiddleware`) properly extracts and stores user context in a context variable, the MCP tool controllers are not accessing this context.

3. **Context Variable Not Used**: The `get_current_user_id()` function from `/src/fastmcp/auth/mcp_integration/user_context_middleware.py` is available but not being called by MCP tool controllers.

### Impact
- Projects created by authenticated users are not associated with their accounts
- Frontend filtering by user_id fails to show user-specific projects
- Multi-tenancy is broken as all projects default to `'default_id'`
- User data isolation is compromised

### Files Affected (41 files with 'default_id' hardcoding)
- Primary controllers needing fixes:
  - `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/project_mcp_controller.py`
  - `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/task_mcp_controller.py`
  - `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/git_branch_mcp_controller.py`
  - `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/agent_mcp_controller.py`

### Recommended Fix

#### Solution: Integrate User Context from JWT Token

1. **Import user context retrieval function** in all MCP controllers:
```python
from fastmcp.auth.mcp_integration.user_context_middleware import get_current_user_id
```

2. **Modify controller methods** to retrieve actual user ID:
```python
def manage_project(self, action: str, project_id: Optional[str] = None, ...):
    # Get actual user ID from context, fallback to provided or default
    actual_user_id = get_current_user_id()
    if actual_user_id:
        user_id = actual_user_id
    elif user_id is None:
        user_id = "default_id"  # Only as last resort
```

3. **Update facade factories** to accept user context properly
4. **Ensure middleware is properly configured** in the server initialization

### Test Case to Verify Fix
```python
# Create project with authenticated user
result = mcp__dhafnck_mcp_http__manage_project(
    action="create",
    name="test-project",
    description="Test project"
)
# Verify result['project']['user_id'] matches authenticated user's ID
```

## Issue 2: Global Context Creation Fails Due to Database Schema Mismatch

### Problem Description
Cannot create global context due to missing `user_id` column in the `global_contexts` table.

### Error Message
```
(psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn) column global_contexts.user_id does not exist
```

### Root Cause
Database schema mismatch - the ORM model expects a `user_id` column in `global_contexts` table but the actual database schema doesn't have it. Global context should be singleton and not user-scoped.

### Impact
- Cannot create hierarchical context structure
- Project context creation fails as it requires global context parent
- Context inheritance chain is broken

### Recommended Fix
1. Remove `user_id` field from GlobalContext ORM model
2. Or run database migration to add the column if user-scoped global contexts are intended

## Prompt for Fix (Issue 1 - Priority)

```markdown
# Fix User Context Integration in MCP Tools

## Problem
MCP tools are creating all resources with `user_id = 'default_id'` instead of using the authenticated user's ID from the JWT token. This causes projects/tasks to not appear in the frontend for authenticated users.

## Requirements
1. Integrate the existing `UserContextMiddleware` with MCP tool controllers
2. Retrieve the actual user ID from the JWT token context
3. Only fallback to 'default_id' when no authentication is present
4. Ensure backward compatibility for test environments

## Files to Modify
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/project_mcp_controller.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/task_mcp_controller.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/git_branch_mcp_controller.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/agent_mcp_controller.py`

## Implementation Steps
1. Import `get_current_user_id` from `fastmcp.auth.mcp_integration.user_context_middleware`
2. In each controller's manage method, retrieve actual user ID before processing
3. Pass the correct user_id to facade factories
4. Test with authenticated requests to verify user association

## Success Criteria
- Projects created via MCP tools show correct user_id (not 'default_id')
- Frontend displays user-specific projects when filtered by authenticated user
- Existing tests continue to pass with 'default_id' fallback
```

## Issue 3: Agent Registration Fails Due to user_id UUID Constraint

### Problem Description
Cannot assign agents to branches because agent auto-registration fails with UUID constraint violation.

### Error Message
```
invalid input syntax for type uuid: "default_id"
```

### Root Cause
The agents table has a `user_id` column with UUID type constraint, but the code tries to insert 'default_id' as a string.

### Impact
- Cannot assign agents to branches
- Agent orchestration features are broken
- Multi-agent workflows cannot be tested

---

## Issue 4: Task Creation Fails Silently

### Problem Description
Task creation fails with generic error message without specific details about the failure.

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Failed to save task to database. This may be due to an invalid git_branch_id or database constraint violation.",
    "code": "OPERATION_FAILED"
  }
}
```

### Suspected Root Cause
Likely related to the same user_id UUID constraint issue affecting other tables. The tasks table probably has a user_id column expecting UUID but receiving 'default_id'.

### Impact
- Cannot create tasks
- Core functionality of task management is broken
- Cannot test task dependencies, subtasks, or completion flows

---

## Summary of Issues Found and Resolved

### Original Issues:
1. **Critical**: User context not integrated - all resources created with 'default_id'
2. **High**: Global context schema mismatch preventing context hierarchy  
3. **High**: Agent registration fails due to user_id UUID constraint
4. **High**: Task creation fails, likely due to same user_id issue
5. **Medium**: No automatic context creation for better UX (already documented in CLAUDE.md)

### Resolution Summary (2025-08-20):

#### 1. User Context Integration (✅ RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Integrated JWT user context retrieval in all MCP controllers
- Modified task, project, agent, and git branch controllers to retrieve user context
- Normalized all user IDs to use UUID format (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 for default)
- Created domain constants module for consistent user ID handling

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/domain/constants.py` (created)
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/task_mcp_controller.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/project_mcp_controller.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/agent_mcp_controller.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/application/factories/task_facade_factory.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/application/factories/agent_facade_factory.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/task_repository_factory.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/agent_repository_factory.py`

#### 2. Global Context Schema Issue (✅ RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Fixed database model to match actual schema
- Removed `user_id` field from GlobalContext ORM model (global context is organization-wide)
- Fixed organization_id handling to use UUID instead of string
- Store organization name in JSON metadata field

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/database/models.py`
- `/src/fastmcp/task_management/infrastructure/repositories/global_context_repository.py`

#### 3. Agent Registration UUID Constraints (✅ RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Fixed agent repository factory to normalize user IDs
- Updated agent repository factory to use normalized UUIDs
- Modified agent facade factory to pass user context properly

#### 4. Task Creation Failures (✅ RESOLVED)  
**Solution**: Fixed user ID propagation through all layers
- Updated task facade factory to normalize user IDs
- Fixed `_derive_context_from_identifiers` method to use normalized UUIDs
- Ensured user context flows correctly from controller → facade → repository

## Verification Tests Performed
✅ Project creation and listing
✅ Task creation with valid git_branch_id
✅ Agent registration and listing
✅ Global context creation and retrieval
✅ All operations using normalized UUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system for any edge cases with UUID normalization
2. Consider adding database migration to ensure all existing 'default_id' values are converted
3. Add comprehensive integration tests for user context flow
4. Document the UUID normalization strategy for future developers

### Prompt 1: Fix Database Schema Inconsistencies (Priority 1)

```markdown
# Fix Database Schema user_id Type Inconsistencies

## Problem
Multiple database tables have user_id columns with UUID type constraints, but the application code uses 'default_id' string as default, causing type mismatch errors.

## Affected Tables
- global_contexts - missing user_id column entirely
- agents - user_id column expects UUID but gets 'default_id'
- tasks - suspected same issue (creation fails)
- projects - likely has same issue

## Requirements
1. Audit all database tables for user_id column types
2. Decide on consistent approach:
   - Option A: Change user_id columns to VARCHAR to accept 'default_id'
   - Option B: Use a special UUID for default user (e.g., '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')
   - Option C: Make user_id nullable and use NULL instead of 'default_id'
3. Create and run migration scripts
4. Update ORM models to match schema
5. Test with both authenticated users and default scenarios

## Success Criteria
- All MCP tools can create resources without UUID type errors
- Both authenticated users (UUID) and default users work
- Database schema is consistent across all tables
```

### Prompt 2: Implement User Context Integration (Priority 2)

```markdown
# Integrate JWT User Context in MCP Tools

## Problem
MCP tool controllers don't retrieve authenticated user ID from JWT tokens, defaulting everything to 'default_id'.

## Solution Architecture
The UserContextMiddleware already extracts user info from JWT tokens and stores it in context variables. We need to integrate this with MCP controllers.

## Implementation Tasks
1. Import get_current_user_id from fastmcp.auth.mcp_integration.user_context_middleware
2. Modify all MCP controllers to retrieve user context
3. Update facade factories to properly handle user context
4. Ensure backward compatibility for unauthenticated requests

## Files to Update
- All controllers in /src/fastmcp/task_management/interface/controllers/
- Facade factories in /src/fastmcp/task_management/application/factories/
- Repository factories to handle proper user scoping

## Testing Requirements
- Create project with authenticated user -> should show user's UUID
- Create project without auth -> should use appropriate default
- Verify frontend can filter and display user-specific resources
```

### Prompt 3: Add Comprehensive Error Logging (Priority 3)

```markdown
# Implement Detailed Error Logging for MCP Tools

## Problem
MCP tools return generic error messages that don't help identify root causes. Need detailed logging for debugging.

## Requirements
1. Add structured logging to all MCP controllers
2. Log full stack traces for database errors
3. Include request context (user_id, parameters) in logs
4. Add correlation IDs for request tracking
5. Implement different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## Implementation
- Configure Python logging with proper formatters
- Add try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
- Return sanitized errors to clients while logging full details
- Add request/response middleware for comprehensive logging

## Success Criteria
- All errors are logged with sufficient detail for debugging
- Log files are properly rotated and managed
- Sensitive information is not exposed in client responses
- Correlation IDs allow tracking requests through the system
