# DhafnckMCP Testing Issues Report
**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Test Scope:** Comprehensive testing of dhafnck_mcp_http tools  
**Environment:** Local development with Supabase database

## Summary
Tested all major dhafnck_mcp_http tool actions including project management, git branch management, task management, subtask management, and context management across different hierarchy layers.

## Issues Found

### 1. Global Context Requirement for Project Context Creation
**Issue:** Cannot create project context without first creating global context  
**Error:** `Cannot create project context without global context. Please create global context first.`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Requires additional step before project setup  
**Resolution:** Successfully created global context first, then project context worked

### 2. Branch Context Auto-Creation
**Issue:** Branch context is automatically created when branch is created  
**Error:** `Branch context already exists for git_branch_id`  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Attempting to create branch context returns error  
**Resolution:** Use `update` action instead of `create` for existing branch contexts

### 3. Task Data Persistence Issue
**Issue:** Tasks created via MCP tools are not persisting or being retrieved correctly  
**Evidence:** 
- Successfully created 7 tasks (5 on first branch, 2 on second)
- `list` action returns 0 tasks for all branches
- Project statistics show 0 task_count for all branches
- Subtasks remain accessible even though parent tasks can't be retrieved
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Task management functionality broken after initial creation

### 4. Insights Found Parameter Validation
**Issue:** `insights_found` parameter requires specific format but error message unclear  
**Error:** `Error calling tool 'manage_subtask': 'valid'`  
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Had to retry without the parameter to complete subtask  
**Resolution:** Removed `insights_found` parameter and completion succeeded

### 5. Task Not Found for Subtask Creation
**Issue:** Task UUID not recognized when creating subtasks for tasks on second branch  
**Error:** `Failed to create subtask: Task 2c0f4a67-e593-4a95-9d23-9b2ad7a4fe90 not found`  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Cannot create subtasks for tasks that were successfully created earlier

## Successful Operations

### Project Management ✅
- Created 2 projects successfully
- Retrieved project details
- Listed all projects
- Updated project description
- Health check operations working

### Git Branch Management ✅
- Created 2 feature branches
- Listed branches
- Retrieved branch details
- Updated branch descriptions
- Agent assignment operations working

### Context Management ✅
- Global context creation and retrieval
- Project context creation and retrieval  
- Branch context updates and retrieval
- Context inheritance working correctly (global → project → branch)
- All hierarchy levels accessible

### Subtask Management (Partial) ⚠️
- Created 4 subtasks for first task successfully
- Updated subtask progress
- Listed subtasks
- Retrieved individual subtask details
- Completed subtask with summary
- Deleted subtask successfully
- **Issue:** Cannot create subtasks for other tasks due to task persistence problem

### Task Management ❌
- Initial creation appears successful (returns task IDs)
- Tasks not retrievable after creation
- Search, list, get operations return empty results
- Task dependencies were set but cannot be verified

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be with task data persistence or retrieval:
1. Tasks are created and return valid UUIDs
2. The creation response indicates success
3. However, subsequent retrieval operations find no tasks
4. This suggests either:
   - Tasks are not being committed to the database
   - Tasks are being created in a different context/scope than being queried
   - There's a filter or permission issue preventing retrieval

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Task Persistence**: Check database commit logic in task creation
2. **Verify Context Scoping**: Ensure tasks are being created and queried in the same context
3. **Check Transaction Handling**: Verify database transactions are being committed
4. **Add Logging**: Enhanced logging around task creation and retrieval operations
5. **Fix Parameter Validation**: Improve error messages for parameter format issues

## Test Coverage

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Project Management | ✅ Complete | All operations working |
| Git Branch Management | ✅ Complete | All operations working |
| Task Management | ❌ Failed | Creation works, retrieval broken |
| Subtask Management | ⚠️ Partial | Works for existing tasks only |
| Context Management | ✅ Complete | All hierarchy levels working |
| Agent Management | ⚠️ Not Tested | Blocked by task issues |
| Compliance Management | ❌ Not Tested | Out of scope for this test |

## Next Steps

1. Debug task persistence issue - highest priority
2. Fix task retrieval operations
3. Complete subtask testing for all tasks
4. Test agent assignment to tasks
5. Test task completion workflow
6. Verify context updates with task operations
