# MCP Tools Testing Issues Report
**Date**: 2025-08-21
**Test Environment**: dhafnck_mcp_http MCP server
**Tester**: AI Agent

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive testing of dhafnck_mcp_http tools revealed several critical issues primarily related to user authentication requirements and database schema mismatches. While basic CRUD operations work for projects and tasks, several advanced features fail due to missing user_id columns in the database.

## Issues Found

### 1. Git Branch Management - Authentication Required
**Severity**: HIGH
**Actions Affected**: 
- `manage_git_branch` - create, list, update, assign_agent
**Error Message**: 
```
"Project repository creation requires user authentication. No user ID was provided."
```
**Impact**: Cannot create or manage git branches through MCP tools
**Root Cause**: Missing user authentication context in MCP calls

### 2. Task Get Operation Fails
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Actions Affected**:
- `manage_task` - get action
**Error Message**:
```
"The task retrieval could not be completed."
"error_type": "TypeError"
```
**Impact**: Cannot retrieve individual task details
**Root Cause**: Implementation issue in get action handler

### 3. Subtask Creation - Authentication Required
**Severity**: HIGH
**Actions Affected**:
- `manage_subtask` - create action
**Error Message**:
```
"Subtask context derivation requires user authentication. No user ID was provided."
```
**Impact**: Cannot create subtasks for any task
**Root Cause**: Missing user authentication context

### 4. Task Completion - Database Schema Mismatch
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Actions Affected**:
- `manage_task` - complete action
**Error Message**:
```
"column task_contexts.user_id does not exist"
```
**Impact**: Cannot complete tasks
**Root Cause**: Database schema missing user_id column in task_contexts table

### 5. Branch Context Creation - Database Schema Mismatch
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Actions Affected**:
- `manage_context` - create action for branch level
**Error Message**:
```
"column branch_contexts.user_id does not exist"
```
**Impact**: Cannot create branch-level contexts
**Root Cause**: Database schema missing user_id column in branch_contexts table

## Working Features
The following features tested successfully:
- ✅ Project management (create, list, update, get, health_check)
- ✅ Project context operations (update, get with inheritance)
- ✅ Task creation and basic management
- ✅ Task list, search, next operations
- ✅ Task dependency management
- ✅ Task update operations
- ✅ Global context retrieval

## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Total Actions | Working | Failed | Success Rate |
|-----------|--------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Projects | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Git Branches | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0% |
| Tasks | 10 | 8 | 2 | 80% |
| Subtasks | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0% |
| Context | 4 | 2 | 2 | 50% |

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Add user_id columns to task_contexts and branch_contexts tables
   - Implement user authentication bypass for MCP operations
   - Fix TypeError in task get operation

2. **Long-term Solutions**:
   - Consider making user_id optional for MCP operations
   - Implement service account concept for automated operations
   - Add comprehensive error handling for missing authentication

## Testing Details

### Test Execution Flow
1. Created 2 new projects (gamma-2025, delta-2025) ✅
2. Updated project description ✅
3. Set project context with technology stack ✅
4. Attempted git branch creation ❌
5. Created 5 tasks on first branch, 2 on second branch ✅
6. Updated task status and details ✅
7. Listed and searched tasks ✅
8. Added task dependencies ✅
9. Attempted subtask creation ❌
10. Attempted task completion ❌
11. Verified context hierarchy (global → project) ✅
12. Attempted branch context creation ❌

### Test Data Created
- Projects: test-project-gamma-2025, test-project-delta-2025
- Tasks: 7 tasks created across 2 branches
- Dependencies: 2 dependency relationships established
- Context: Project context successfully updated with team settings

## Next Steps
1. Fix database schema issues (add missing user_id columns)
2. Implement authentication solution for MCP operations
3. Fix task get operation TypeError
4. Re-test all failed operations after fixes
5. Implement integration tests to prevent regression
