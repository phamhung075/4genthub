# Frontend Context Loading Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking the context button in the frontend UI, users would see an error:
```json
{
  "status": "failure",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Context not found: 56f5eb30-957b-456f-947d-007f5a67a659"
  }
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Historical Tasks**: Tasks created before the auto-context creation feature was implemented don't have associated contexts
2. **API Error Handling**: The frontend API was returning error responses as if they were valid context data
3. **UI Feedback**: The TaskContextDialog didn't handle missing context gracefully, showing raw error messages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Error Detection (api.ts)
Enhanced `getTaskContext` to properly detect and handle error responses:
```typescript
// Check if the response indicates an error
if (toolResult.success === false || toolResult.status === 'failure') {
  console.error('Context not found:', toolResult.error?.message || 'Unknown error');
  return null;
}
```

### 2. Graceful UI Handling (TaskList.tsx)
Updated `handleViewContext` to provide helpful messages when context doesn't exist:
```typescript
if (!context) {
  setTaskContext({
    message: "No context available for this task",
    info: "This task may have been created before context tracking was enabled...",
    suggestions: [
      "Complete the task with a summary to create context",
      "Update the task to trigger context creation"
    ]
  });
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Context Dialog (TaskContextDialog.tsx)
Added dedicated UI sections for:
- **No Context Available**: Yellow warning box with helpful suggestions
- **Error State**: Red error box for actual failures
- **Loading State**: Clear loading indicator

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear Messaging**: Users now see "No context available" instead of technical error messages
2. **Actionable Suggestions**: Users are guided on how to create context (complete or update the task)
3. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded messages (yellow for warnings, red for errors)
4. **Graceful Degradation**: The UI remains functional even when context is missing

## Technical Notes
- This fix only addresses the frontend display issue
- Backend auto-context creation (implemented in 2025-01-19) handles new tasks
- Existing tasks without context will continue to show the helpful message until they're updated or completed

## Files Modified
1. `/dhafnck-frontend/src/api.ts` - Added error detection in getTaskContext
2. `/dhafnck-frontend/src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Enhanced handleViewContext with graceful fallback
3. `/dhafnck-frontend/src/components/TaskContextDialog.tsx` - Added message and error state handling

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Click context button on any task created before auto-context was implemented
2. Should see yellow message box with suggestions instead of error
3. Complete or update the task to trigger context creation
4. Context should then display normally
