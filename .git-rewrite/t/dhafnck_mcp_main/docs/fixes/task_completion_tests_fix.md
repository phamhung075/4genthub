# Task Completion Tests Fix

## Summary
Fixed failing tests in `test_task_completion_unified_context.py` that were expecting old behavior where context was required for task completion.

## Problem
The `TaskCompletionService` was updated to auto-create context during task completion if it doesn't exist, but the tests still expected the old behavior where missing context would block completion.

## Changes Made

### Test Updates
1. **`test_can_complete_task_without_context`**
   - Changed expectation from `can_complete is False` to `can_complete is True`
   - Updated test description to reflect that context is now auto-created

2. **`test_validate_task_completion_raises_error`**
   - Changed to use incomplete subtasks as the trigger for validation error
   - Updated assertion to check for subtask error message instead of context error

3. **`test_get_completion_blockers`**
   - Changed expected blocker count from 2 to 1
   - Removed expectation of context-related blocker since context is auto-created

## Key Insight
The TaskCompletionService was updated to be more user-friendly by auto-creating context during task completion if it doesn't exist. This removes a common friction point where users had to manually create context before completing tasks.

## Test Results
âœ… All 8 tests in `test_task_completion_unified_context.py` now pass
