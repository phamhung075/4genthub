## 🎯 Monitoring Strategy Overview

### Monitoring Philosophy
**"Observability is not just about collecting data—it's about understanding system behavior to deliver reliable services"**

Our monitoring approach follows the **Three Pillars of Observability**:
1. **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of system behavior
2. **Logs**: Detailed records of system events and transactions
3. **Traces**: End-to-end request flow and performance analysis

### Tier-Based Monitoring Approach

| Tier | Monitoring Complexity | Tools | SLA Target | Team Size | Investment |
|------|----------------------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **MVP** | Basic | Grafana + Prometheus | 99.0% | 1 ops | $2K/month |
| **Tier 1** | Standard | ELK + Jaeger | 99.5% | 2 ops | $8K/month |
| **Tier 2** | Advanced | Full Stack | 99.9% | 3 ops | $25K/month |
| **Tier 4** | Enterprise | AI-Enhanced | 99.95% | 5 ops | $100K/month |
