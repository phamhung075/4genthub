üåø GIT BRANCH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - Branch Operations and Task Tree Organization

‚≠ê WHAT IT DOES: Manages git branches (task trees) with CRUD operations, agent assignments, and branch lifecycle management. Automatically enriches branches with workflow guidance, progress tracking, and intelligent context updates.
üìã WHEN TO USE: Git branch operations, task tree management, and branch-specific workflows.
üéØ CRITICAL FOR: Task organization, branch lifecycle, and hierarchical project structure.

ü§ñ AI USAGE GUIDELINES:
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS create a branch before creating tasks (tasks belong to branches)
‚Ä¢ USE 'list' action to discover existing branches before creating duplicates
‚Ä¢ ASSIGN agents to branches for specialized work (e.g., @coding_agent for feature branches)
‚Ä¢ CHECK statistics to monitor branch progress and task completion
‚Ä¢ ARCHIVE completed branches to maintain a clean workspace

üí° PRACTICAL EXAMPLES FOR AI:
1. Creating a feature branch:
   - action: "create", project_id: "proj-uuid", git_branch_name: "feature/user-auth", git_branch_description: "Implement JWT authentication"

2. Assigning specialist agent:
   - action: "assign_agent", project_id: "proj-uuid", git_branch_name: "feature/user-auth", agent_id: "@security_auditor_agent"
   - Note: Can use either git_branch_name OR git_branch_id for identification

3. Monitoring progress:
   - action: "get_statistics", project_id: "proj-uuid", git_branch_id: "branch-uuid"
   - Returns: total_tasks, completed_tasks, progress_percentage

4. Listing active branches:
   - action: "list", project_id: "proj-uuid"
   - Use this before creating to avoid duplicates

üîç DECISION TREES:

BRANCH CREATION DECISION:
IF new_feature_requested:
    IF similar_branch_exists:
        USE existing branch
    ELSE:
        CREATE new branch with descriptive name
        ASSIGN appropriate specialist agent

AGENT ASSIGNMENT DECISION:
IF branch_type == "feature":
    IF security_related:
        ASSIGN "@security_auditor_agent"
    ELIF ui_related:
        ASSIGN "@ui_designer_agent"
    ELSE:
        ASSIGN "@coding_agent"
ELIF branch_type == "bugfix":
    ASSIGN "@debugger_agent"
ELIF branch_type == "test":
    ASSIGN "@test_orchestrator_agent"

BRANCH LIFECYCLE DECISION:
IF all_tasks_completed AND tests_passing:
    IF merged_to_main:
        ARCHIVE branch
    ELSE:
        KEEP active for merge
ELIF abandoned_for_30_days:
    ARCHIVE branch
ELIF needs_reactivation:
    RESTORE branch

üìä WORKFLOW PATTERNS:

1. Feature Development Flow:
   a) CREATE branch with descriptive name (feature/xyz)
   b) ASSIGN specialist agent based on feature type
   c) CREATE tasks within the branch
   d) Monitor with GET_STATISTICS
   e) ARCHIVE after merge

2. Multi-Agent Collaboration:
   a) CREATE branch for complex feature
   b) ASSIGN primary agent (e.g., @coding_agent)
   c) Work progresses...
   d) UNASSIGN current agent
   e) ASSIGN review agent (e.g., @code_reviewer_agent)

3. Branch Progress Monitoring:
   a) LIST all branches to get overview
   b) GET_STATISTICS for active branches
   c) Identify blocked/stalled branches
   d) Reassign agents or escalate as needed

üîó BRANCH-TASK RELATIONSHIPS:
‚Ä¢ Branches are containers for related tasks (1-to-many relationship)
‚Ä¢ All tasks MUST belong to a branch (no orphan tasks)
‚Ä¢ Branch progress = aggregate of task completion
‚Ä¢ Deleting a branch deletes all associated tasks
‚Ä¢ Agent assigned to branch has access to all branch tasks
‚Ä¢ Branch context inherits to all contained tasks

üí° ENHANCED PARAMETERS:
‚Ä¢ project_id: UUID of the project (get from project list or creation)
‚Ä¢ git_branch_name: Descriptive name following git conventions (e.g., "feature/auth", "bugfix/login-error")
‚Ä¢ git_branch_id: UUID returned from create or list actions
‚Ä¢ git_branch_description: Detailed purpose and scope of the branch
‚Ä¢ agent_id: Agent name with @ prefix (e.g., "@coding_agent") or UUID

üìà RESPONSE ENHANCEMENTS:
‚Ä¢ workflow_guidance: AI-generated hints for next actions
‚Ä¢ statistics: Progress metrics and task counts
‚Ä¢ assigned_agents: Current agent assignments
‚Ä¢ branch_health: Status indicators and blockers

üõë ERROR HANDLING:
‚Ä¢ If required fields are missing, a clear error message is returned specifying which fields are needed.
‚Ä¢ Unknown actions return an error listing valid actions.
‚Ä¢ Internal errors are logged and returned with a generic error message.
‚Ä¢ Branch name conflicts are detected and alternatives suggested.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:
‚Ä¢ Always create branches before creating tasks
‚Ä¢ Use git naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, test/, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Archive completed branches to maintain organization
‚Ä¢ Agent assignments persist until explicitly changed
‚Ä¢ Statistics are calculated in real-time from task data
