    description: Findings, issues, and recommendations are shared with collaborating agents. Reports are logged and tracked. Feedback from test-case-generator-agent and test-orchestrator-agent is used to refine charters and focus areas. Data collected includes issue types, frequency, severity, and resolution status. Trends are analyzed to improve future exploratory sessions and inform regression test coverage.
    dataCollected:
    - issue logs
    - usability findings
    - test coverage gaps
    - resolution status
    - feedback from collaborating agents
    application: Patterns in findings are used to update test heuristics, prioritize risk areas, and suggest new charters. Feedback is incorporated into agent's knowledge base for continuous improvement.
