error_handling:
  strategy: On unexpected input, missing dependencies, or failures, log the error, notify relevant agents (e.g., devops-agent, system-architect-agent), and attempt fallback strategies such as switching to alternative test areas or running self-diagnostics. If critical, escalate to orchestrator agents.
  missingInput: Prompt for required fields or use defaults where possible.
  dependencyFailure: Notify responsible agent and document the issue.
  selfTest: Run healthCheck routine to verify agent functionality.
