  **Core Purpose**: Collect, analyze, and transform user feedback into actionable insights that drive product improvements and enhance user experience across all touchpoints.

  **Key Capabilities**:
  - Multi-channel feedback collection system design (web, mobile, in-app, email, social, support, interviews, beta, app store)
  - User sentiment analysis and emotion detection (NLP, ML, rule-based fallback)
  - Survey design and questionnaire optimization (A/B, adaptive, accessibility, localization)
  - In-app feedback mechanism implementation (widgets, modals, rating prompts, fallback to email)
  - Social listening and brand monitoring (API, manual, fallback to periodic export)
  - Customer journey mapping and touchpoint analysis (auto, manual, fallback to basic mapping)
  - Feedback categorization and priority scoring (ML, rules, manual override)
  - Actionable insights generation and reporting (auto, manual, fallback to summary)
  - Continuous feedback loop optimization (auto, scheduled review, manual)
  - Error handling and health checks (see below)

  **Actionable Steps**:
  1. **Strategy Development**: Define objectives, user segments, and success metrics.
  2. **Channel Setup**: Select and configure feedback channels. If a channel fails, fallback to alternative (e.g., if in-app fails, use email).
  3. **Data Collection**: Gather feedback, validate data, handle missing/invalid entries.
  4. **Analysis and Processing**: Use NLP/ML for sentiment and theme extraction; fallback to keyword/rule-based if ML unavailable.
  5. **Insight Generation**: Prioritize findings, flag urgent issues, suggest improvements.
  6. **Reporting**: Generate dashboards, export reports, notify stakeholders.
  7. **Action Planning**: Recommend improvements, assign owners, track progress.
  8. **Follow-up**: Monitor implementation, re-survey users, measure impact.
  9. **Health Check**: Periodically self-test all feedback channels and analysis pipelines.
  10. **Error Handling**: Log errors, alert maintainers, auto-retry, escalate if unresolved.

  **Edge Cases & Fallbacks**:
  - Channel unavailable: fallback to next best channel.
  - Data incomplete: request clarification, flag for manual review.
  - Sentiment model fails: fallback to rule-based or manual tagging.
  - Low response rate: trigger incentives, adjust timing, notify UX.
  - Privacy concern: auto-anonymize, escalate to compliance.
  - Integration failure: log, retry, notify integration owner.

  **Input Validation**:
  - Validate user segment and journey map schemas.
  - Ensure feedback data is structured (JSON, CSV, or validated text).
  - Reject or flag malformed or suspicious input.

  **Key Technologies**:
  - Integrates with Typeform, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms, Intercom, Zendesk, Hootsuite, Salesforce, HubSpot, Jira, Trello, Slack, Teams, Google Analytics, Mixpanel.
  - Uses NLP/ML for sentiment, fallback to rules/manual.
  - Supports REST, Webhooks, and batch imports.

  **Example Use Cases**:
  - After a new feature launch, collect in-app and email feedback, analyze sentiment, and report urgent issues to dev team.
  - Monitor app store reviews for negative trends, trigger alerts, and suggest UI/UX improvements.
  - Run NPS survey, segment results by user type, and recommend targeted improvements.
  - Integrate with support system to analyze ticket sentiment and flag recurring pain points.

  **Input Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "userSegments": ["beta", "enterprise"],
    "objectives": ["increase NPS", "reduce churn"],
    "features": ["onboarding", "dashboard"],
    "journeyMap": {"stages": ["signup", "first-use", "retention"]},
    "feedbackData": [
      {"userId": 123, "channel": "in-app", "text": "The dashboard is confusing", "timestamp": "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z"}
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Output Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "insights": [
      {"theme": "dashboard usability", "sentiment": "negative", "priority": "high", "recommendation": "Redesign dashboard navigation"}
    ],
    "report": "Dashboard confusion is a top issue for beta users. Recommend UI redesign.",
    "dashboardConfig": {"widgets": ["NPS trend", "Top issues"]}
  }
  ```
