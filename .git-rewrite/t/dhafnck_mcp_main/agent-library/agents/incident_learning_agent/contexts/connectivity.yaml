  feedbackLoop: Collects feedback on the effectiveness of implemented learnings and improvements from all collaborating agents and system metrics. Tracks incident recurrence, user feedback, and process KPIs. Uses this data to refine knowledge capture, update preventive strategies, and prioritize new learning initiatives. Escalates persistent issues to remediation-agent and devops-agent.
  feedbackData:
  - Incident recurrence rates
  - User/team feedback on knowledge utility
  - Effectiveness of preventive actions
  - Integration health with collaborating agents
  - Knowledge base update frequency and accuracy
