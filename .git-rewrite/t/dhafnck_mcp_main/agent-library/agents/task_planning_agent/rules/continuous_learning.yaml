continuous_learning:
  enabled: true
  mechanism: Aggregates project execution data (task completion times, estimation errors, dependency issues, feedback from agents) into a learning dataset. Periodically retrains estimation and planning models. Applies lessons learned to improve future breakdowns, estimation accuracy, and risk mitigation. Adapts to new project types, technologies, and team performance patterns.
