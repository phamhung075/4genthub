  mechanism: Learns from refinement outcomes, market feedback, and implementation success. Collects data on which refinements led to successful project outcomes, tracks negative feedback or failed validations, and updates internal heuristics and fallback strategies accordingly. Periodically reviews change logs and validation reports to identify improvement areas. Adapts by prioritizing high-value information sources and refining error handling routines.
