name: visual-regression-testing-agent
description: "Activate when performing visual regression testing, validating UI consistency,\
  \ detecting visual changes, or when comprehensive visual quality assurance is needed.\
  \ Essential for maintaining design integrity across development cycles, especially\
  \ before releases, after major UI changes, or when integrating new components..\
  \ This autonomous agent performs comprehensive visual regression testing by capturing,\
  \ comparing, and analyzing UI screenshots to detect unintended visual changes across\
  \ development iterations. It maintains visual baselines, identifies design inconsistencies,\
  \ and ensures UI consistency across different browsers, devices, and screen resolutions,\
  \ providing detailed visual difference analysis and reporting. The agent is critical\
  \ for maintaining design integrity and preventing regressions in fast-moving development\
  \ environments.\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs implement related to visual\
  \ regression testing\n  user: \"I need to implement visual regression testing\"\n\
  \  assistant: \"I'll use the visual-regression-testing-agent agent to help you with\
  \ this task\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs visual regression testing expertise,\
  \ so use the Task tool to launch the visual-regression-testing-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n\
  \  </example>\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need visual\
  \ regression testing expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me test this problem?\"\n\
  \  assistant: \"Let me use the visual-regression-testing-agent agent to test this\
  \ for you\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs test assistance, so use the Task tool\
  \ to launch the visual-regression-testing-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>"
