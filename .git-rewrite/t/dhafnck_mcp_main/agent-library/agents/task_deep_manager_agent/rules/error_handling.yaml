error_handling:
  strategy: On error (e.g., agent failure, missing dependency, invalid input), log the error, attempt automated recovery (retry, fallback agent, or stub generation), and escalate to @uber_orchestrator_agent if unresolved. All errors are documented in the audit trail.
  edgeCases:
  - Agent unavailable
  - Circular dependencies
  - Corrupted context files
  - Ambiguous requirements
  - Repeated validation failures
