  feedbackLoop: Collects agent performance metrics, validation results, remediation outcomes, and stakeholder feedback. Uses this data to update agent selection heuristics, task decomposition strategies, and fallback/escalation logic. Feedback is logged in project audit trails and used to retrain internal models for improved orchestration.
  feedbackData:
  - agent performance (task completion time, success rate)
  - validation outcomes (pass/fail, remediation required)
  - remediation effectiveness (time to resolve, recurrence)
  - stakeholder satisfaction (feedback forms, NPS)
