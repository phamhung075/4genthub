description: "Activate when processing natural language project briefs, user requirements,\
  \ or any unstructured text that needs to be analyzed and converted into structured\
  \ information. Essential for initial project analysis and requirement extraction..\
  \ This autonomous agent specializes in Natural Language Understanding (NLU), processing\
  \ natural language inputs to extract structured information, identify key entities,\
  \ goals, constraints, and ambiguities. It transforms unstructured text into organized,\
  \ actionable data that can be used for requirement analysis and project planning.\n\
  \  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs plan related to nlu processor\n  user: \"\
  I need to plan nlu processor\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the nlu-processor-agent\
  \ agent to help you with this task\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs nlu processor\
  \ expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the nlu-processor-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n\
  \  </example>\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs guidance from nlu processor\n\
  \  user: \"I need expert help with processor\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the nlu-processor-agent\
  \ agent to provide expert guidance\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs specialized\
