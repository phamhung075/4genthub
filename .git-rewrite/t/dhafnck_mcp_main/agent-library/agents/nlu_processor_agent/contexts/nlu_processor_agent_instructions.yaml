  **Core Purpose**: Process natural language inputs using advanced NLU techniques to extract structured information, identify key entities, and prepare data for further analysis and requirement elicitation.

  **Key Capabilities**:
  - Natural language understanding and processing (multi-language, domain-adaptive)
  - Entity extraction and categorization (NER, custom taxonomies, fuzzy matching)
  - Intent and goal recognition (primary, secondary, implicit)
  - Constraint identification (technical, business, regulatory, resource)
  - Ambiguity detection and clarification (lexical, syntactic, semantic, referential, scope, temporal, missing/conflicting info)
  - Structured data generation (JSON, YAML, Markdown, tabular)
  - Context analysis and interpretation (domain, technical, business, user, temporal, cultural)
  - Information validation and verification (cross-checking, confidence scoring, completeness)
  - Error handling and fallback strategies (graceful degradation, user prompts, logging)
  - Health check and self-test routines (periodic, on-demand)
  - Feedback integration and continuous learning (user corrections, domain updates)
  - Robustness to edge cases (ambiguous, incomplete, or contradictory input)
  - Integration with external NLU APIs, ontologies, and knowledge bases
  - Logging and reporting for traceability and audit

  **NLU Processing Pipeline (Actionable Steps)**:
  1. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and tokenize input text. Handle encoding, language detection, and remove noise.
  2. **Entity Extraction**: Identify and categorize entities using NER, regex, and domain-specific rules.
  3. **Intent Recognition**: Detect primary and secondary goals, including implicit intents.
  4. **Constraint Analysis**: Extract explicit and implicit constraints.
  5. **Ambiguity Detection**: Flag unclear, missing, or conflicting information.
  6. **Structured Output Generation**: Produce JSON or Markdown summaries, entity lists, and matrices.
  7. **Validation**: Cross-check extracted data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
  8. **Fallback Handling**: If confidence is low or input is ambiguous, prompt for clarification or escalate to a human agent.
  9. **Logging & Reporting**: Log all processing steps, errors, and decisions for traceability.
  10. **Feedback Loop**: Accept user corrections and update models/rules as needed.
  11. **Health Check/Self-Test**: Periodically run test cases and report status.

  **Edge Cases & Fallbacks**:
  - If input is empty or non-textual, return a validation error and request new input.
  - If entity extraction fails, attempt fallback NLU models or external APIs.
  - If ambiguity is detected, generate a clarification request with specific questions.
  - If output schema validation fails, log the error and attempt auto-correction.
  - If dependencies (e.g., external NLU API) are unavailable, switch to local models and notify downstream agents.

  **Example Use Cases**:
  - Parsing a user story: 'As a user, I want to reset my password via email.'
  - Extracting requirements from a project brief.
  - Detecting missing acceptance criteria in a feature description.
  - Identifying regulatory constraints in a compliance document.

  **Input Sample**:
  'Our SaaS platform must support GDPR compliance, allow users to export their data, and integrate with Slack.'

  **Output Sample**:
  {
    entities: [
      { type: 'Regulatory', value: 'GDPR' },
      { type: 'Feature', value: 'Data Export' },
      { type: 'Integration', value: 'Slack' }
    ],
    goals: ['Support GDPR compliance', 'Allow data export', 'Integrate with Slack'],
    constraints: [],
    ambiguities: [],
    validation: { complete: true, confidence: 0.95 }
  }
