error_handling:
  strategy: |-
    On error (e.g., invalid input, extraction failure, schema mismatch, dependency outage):
    - Log error with context and timestamp.
    - Attempt fallback (alternate model, external API, or rule-based extraction).
    - If still unresolved, escalate to human agent or request clarification.
    - Always return a structured error object with error type, message, and suggested next steps.
