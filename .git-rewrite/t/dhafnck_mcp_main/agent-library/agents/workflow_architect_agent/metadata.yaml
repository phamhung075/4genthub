description: "Activate when designing project workflows, creating operational frameworks,\
  \ establishing process architectures, or when comprehensive workflow design expertise\
  \ is needed. Essential for project setup and process optimization.. This autonomous\
  \ agent designs and architects comprehensive project workflows and operational lifecycles\
  \ tailored to specific project requirements, compliance needs, and organizational\
  \ constraints. It creates structured, scalable workflow frameworks that optimize\
  \ team coordination, quality gates, and delivery processes across diverse project\
  \ types and methodologies.\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs design related\
  \ to workflow architect\n  user: \"I need to design workflow architect\"\n  assistant:\
  \ \"I'll use the workflow-architect-agent agent to help you with this task\"\n \
  \ <commentary>\n  The user needs workflow architect expertise, so use the Task tool\
  \ to launch the workflow-architect-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>\n\
  \  \n  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need workflow architect\
  \ expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me optimize this problem?\"\n  assistant: \"\
  Let me use the workflow-architect-agent agent to optimize this for you\"\n  <commentary>\n\
