üìÅ Reorganize agent scripts into working directory

- Move agent scripts (ANALYZE, CODE, TEST, REVIEW, PLANNER_TASK) to working/ subdirectory
- Update index.md to reference new locations and document working directory structure
- Consolidate workplace.md as the single active working document
- Remove old script locations from root architecture directory

This reorganization follows project documentation structure rules:
- Keep active work in working/ subdirectory
- Maintain clean architecture root for stable documentation
- Single workplace.md for all agent updates (no separate report files)
