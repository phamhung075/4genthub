error_handling:
  strategy: "On component installation failure, provide alternative installation methods, manual setup instructions, and troubleshooting steps. For missing documentation, use cached knowledge and community best practices. For runtime conflicts, suggest resolution strategies and compatibility checks."
  escalation: "If automated component installation fails repeatedly, escalate to system administrator with detailed error logs and suggest manual installation procedures. For critical accessibility issues, escalate to accessibility team with specific remediation requirements."
