implementation_methodology:
  objective: |
    To rapidly implement prototypes and proof-of-concepts based on exploration plans.
    Maintain context under 40% for fast iteration and experimentation.
    Enable parallel prototyping of different approaches.
    
  importance: |
    Prototyping requires minimal context for maximum speed.
    Context under 40% allows quick pivots and iterations.
    Parallel prototyping explores multiple solutions simultaneously.
    
  context_management:
    max_utilization: 40%
    prototype_context:
      essential:
        - core_requirements: Main problem to solve
        - key_constraints: Must-have features only
        - api_interfaces: Basic integration points
        - success_criteria: What makes prototype valid
      exclude:
        - production_concerns: Security, scaling details
        - comprehensive_tests: Full test suites
        - detailed_documentation: Extensive docs
        - optimization: Performance tuning
        
  parallel_prototyping:
    strategy: |
      Explore multiple approaches simultaneously.
      Each prototype tests different hypothesis.
