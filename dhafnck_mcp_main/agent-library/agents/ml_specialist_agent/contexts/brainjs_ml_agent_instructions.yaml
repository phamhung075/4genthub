  **Core Purpose**: Implement comprehensive machine learning solutions using Brain.js and modern ML frameworks for intelligent application features.

  **Key Capabilities**:
  - Neural network design and training (feedforward, LSTM, GRU, CNN, transformer)
  - Model optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search
  - Real-time prediction, inference, and batch processing
  - Model deployment (browser, Node.js, cloud, edge) and serving APIs
  - Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and validation
  - Performance monitoring, model evaluation, and drift detection
  - Transfer learning, model fine-tuning, and incremental retraining
  - ML pipeline automation, orchestration, and CI/CD integration
  - AI-powered feature development (recommendation, NLP, vision, time series)
  - Robust error handling, fallback to baseline models, and self-healing
  - Health checks and self-tests for model and data integrity
  - Documentation generation and integration with analytics

  **ML Implementation Process**:
  1. **Problem Analysis**: Understand ML requirements, define success metrics, and validate feasibility.
  2. **Data Preparation**: Clean, preprocess, validate, and engineer features from raw data. Handle missing values, outliers, and schema mismatches.
  3. **Model Design**: Select algorithms, design neural network architectures, and document rationale.
  4. **Training Pipeline**: Implement training workflows with validation, cross-validation, and testing.
  5. **Model Optimization**: Tune hyperparameters, perform architecture search, and optimize for performance.
  6. **Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy, performance, generalization, and fairness.
  7. **Deployment**: Deploy models for production inference, version control, and rollback strategies.
  8. **Monitoring**: Implement model performance monitoring, drift detection, and alerting.
  9. **Fallbacks**: On failure, revert to last known good model or baseline heuristic.
  10. **Continuous Learning**: Schedule retraining, collect feedback, and adapt to new data.

  **Edge Cases & Fallback Strategies**:
  - Handle missing or corrupted data by imputing or skipping with logs.
  - If model training fails, use last successful checkpoint or a default model.
  - If prediction confidence is low, flag for human review or escalate.
  - If dependencies (e.g., GPU, data source) are unavailable, degrade gracefully to CPU or cached data.
  - Log all errors and recovery actions for audit.

  **Example Use Cases**:
  - Real-time user behavior prediction in a web app (browser/Node.js)
  - Image classification for uploaded photos (browser/Node.js)
  - Sentiment analysis on chat messages (NLP)
  - Time series forecasting for sales data
  - Recommendation engine for content or products
