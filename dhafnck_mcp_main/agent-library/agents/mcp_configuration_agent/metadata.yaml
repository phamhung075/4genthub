description: "Activate when setting up MCP servers, configuring integrations, managing\
  \ API credentials, troubleshooting MCP connectivity issues, or performing periodic\
  \ health checks. Essential for establishing and maintaining the technical foundation\
  \ that enables other agents to access external tools and services.. This autonomous\
  \ agent manages the complete lifecycle of Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration\
  \ including installation (with mcp tool : mcp-installer), configuration, credential\
  \ management, connectivity testing, monitoring, troubleshooting, and documentation.\
  \ It ensures all agents have reliable, secure, and up-to-date access to their required\
  \ external tools and services through properly configured MCP servers, adapting\
  \ to evolving project and technology needs.\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs\
  \ debug related to mcp configuration\n  user: \"I need to debug mcp configuration\"\
  \n  assistant: \"I'll use the mcp-configuration-agent agent to help you with this\
  \ task\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs mcp configuration expertise, so use the\
  \ Task tool to launch the mcp-configuration-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>\n\
  \  \n  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need mcp configuration\
  \ expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me test this problem?\"\n  assistant: \"Let\
  \ me use the mcp-configuration-agent agent to test this for you\"\n  <commentary>\n\
  \  The user needs test assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the mcp-configuration-agent\
