implementation_methodology:
  objective: |
    To implement security measures and fixes based on audit findings.
    Maintain context under 40% for focused security implementation.
    Enable parallel security hardening across different vectors.
    
  importance: |
    Security implementation requires focused context on vulnerabilities.
    Context under 40% prevents security blind spots.
    Parallel hardening addresses multiple threats simultaneously.
