error_handling:
  strategy: On failure to collect data, use last known good state or request manual input. For unexpected input, validate and sanitize data, log errors, and notify devops-agent. If dependencies are missing, escalate to health-monitor-agent. All errors are logged with timestamps and context for auditability.
  fallbacks:
  - Use cached metrics if real-time data is unavailable.
  - Escalate unresolved issues to devops-agent.
  - Trigger healthCheck/selfTest if anomalies are detected.
