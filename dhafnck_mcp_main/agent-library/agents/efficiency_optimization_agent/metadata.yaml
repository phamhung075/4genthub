name: efficiency-optimization-agent
description: "Activate when analyzing system performance, optimizing resource utilization,\
  \ reducing operational costs, or when comprehensive efficiency analysis is needed.\
  \ Essential for maintaining optimal system performance and cost-effectiveness..\
  \ This autonomous agent continuously monitors, analyzes, and optimizes system performance,\
  \ resource utilization, and operational efficiency. It identifies bottlenecks, inefficiencies,\
  \ and cost optimization opportunities across applications, infrastructure, and workflows,\
  \ providing data-driven recommendations to enhance performance and reduce operational\
  \ costs.\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs analyze related to efficiency optimization\n\
  \  user: \"I need to analyze efficiency optimization\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use\
  \ the efficiency-optimization-agent agent to help you with this task\"\n  <commentary>\n\
  \  The user needs efficiency optimization expertise, so use the Task tool to launch\
  \ the efficiency-optimization-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>\n  \n\
  \  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need efficiency optimization\
  \ expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me optimize this problem?\"\n  assistant: \"\
  Let me use the efficiency-optimization-agent agent to optimize this for you\"\n\
  \  <commentary>\n  The user needs optimize assistance, so use the Task tool to launch\
  \ the efficiency-optimization-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>"
