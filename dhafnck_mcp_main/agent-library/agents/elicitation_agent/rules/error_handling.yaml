error_handling:
  strategy: |-
    On unexpected input, missing dependencies, or ambiguous requirements, the agent will:
    - Log the issue with context
    - Attempt automated clarification (e.g., rephrase question, request missing info)
    - Escalate to a relevant peer agent (e.g., @system_architect_agent for technical, market-research-agent for business)
    - Notify user or orchestrator if unresolved
    - Mark requirement as 'pending clarification' in output
    - Periodically self-audit for unresolved issues
