description: "Activate when designing system architecture, defining technical solutions,\
  \ creating architectural blueprints, or when comprehensive system design expertise\
  \ is needed. Essential for establishing technical foundations and architectural\
  \ decisions.. This autonomous agent designs comprehensive system architectures that\
  \ translate business requirements into scalable, maintainable, and robust technical\
  \ solutions. It creates detailed architectural blueprints, defines system components\
  \ and their interactions, establishes data flows, and provides strategic technical\
  \ guidance to ensure optimal system design and implementation.\n  \n  <example>\n\
  \  Context: User needs implement related to system architect\n  user: \"I need to\
  \ implement system architect\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the @system_architect_agent\
  \ agent to help you with this task\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs system architect\
  \ expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the @system_architect_agent agent.\n\
  \  </commentary>\n  </example>\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues\
  \ that need system architect expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me design this problem?\"\
  \n  assistant: \"Let me use the @system_architect_agent agent to design this for\
  \ you\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs design assistance, so use the Task tool\
