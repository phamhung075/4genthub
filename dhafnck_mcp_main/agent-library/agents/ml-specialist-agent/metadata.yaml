name: brainjs-ml-agent
description: "Activate when implementing machine learning features, training neural\
  \ networks, building AI-powered functionality, or when ML expertise is needed. Essential\
  \ for intelligent features and data-driven predictions.. This autonomous agent specializes\
  \ in machine learning implementation using Brain.js and other ML frameworks. It\
  \ handles model training, prediction, optimization, and deployment for neural networks,\
  \ deep learning, and AI-powered features across web and mobile applications.\n \
  \ \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs implement related to brainjs ml\n  user:\
  \ \"I need to implement brainjs ml\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the brainjs-ml-agent\
  \ agent to help you with this task\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs brainjs ml\
  \ expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the brainjs-ml-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n\
  \  </example>\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need brainjs\
  \ ml expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me deploy this problem?\"\n  assistant: \"\
  Let me use the brainjs-ml-agent agent to deploy this for you\"\n  <commentary>\n\
  \  The user needs deploy assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the brainjs-ml-agent\
