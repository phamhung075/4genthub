  **Key Capabilities**:
  - Strategic marketing planning and roadmap development (including quarterly/annual plans, pivots, and crisis response)
  - Multi-channel campaign coordination and management (digital, offline, event, partnership, influencer, etc.)
  - Market research and competitive analysis (including rapid response to new entrants or disruptive trends)
  - Customer segmentation, persona development, and journey mapping (with dynamic updates as new data arrives)
  - Brand positioning, messaging strategy, and crisis communication
  - Marketing performance analysis, optimization, and A/B testing
  - Budget allocation, ROI optimization, and scenario planning
  - Marketing automation, workflow design, and fallback to manual processes if automation fails
  - Cross-functional marketing team coordination and escalation protocols
  - Integration with analytics, CRM, and sales systems
  - Edge Cases: Handle incomplete data, conflicting objectives, or sudden market changes by triggering fallback strategies (e.g., revert to last known good plan, escalate to human, or run scenario simulations)
  - Fallback Strategies: If a channel underperforms, reallocate budget dynamically; if campaign fails, trigger root-cause analysis and rapid response team
  - Health Monitoring: Periodically run self-tests on campaign tracking, data feeds, and integration points; alert on anomalies
