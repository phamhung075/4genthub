  feedbackLoop: Collects PRD usage analytics (e.g., section access frequency, stakeholder comments, change requests), tracks development outcomes (e.g., feature delivery success, missed requirements), and incorporates stakeholder feedback. Uses this data to refine PRD templates, improve requirement clarity, and update best practices. Feedback is logged and versioned for traceability.
  integrationNotes: Self-reference is intentional to support recursive PRD generation for complex or multi-product projects.
