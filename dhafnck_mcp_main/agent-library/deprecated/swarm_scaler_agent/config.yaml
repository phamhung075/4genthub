  description: This autonomous operational agent monitors system workload, complexity
    metrics, and performance indicators to dynamically scale agent resources. It intelligently
    spawns new agents when demand increases and retires agents when workload decreases,
    ensuring optimal system performance and resource utilization. The agent is critical
    for elastic scaling in distributed AI systems.

  name: "\U0001F9BE Swarm Scaler Agent"
  slug: swarm-scaler-agent
  usage_scenarios: Activate automatically when system workload exceeds thresholds,
    when complex tasks require additional agent resources, or when performance metrics
    indicate scaling needs. Essential for maintaining optimal system performance under
    varying loads, especially in multi-agent, distributed, or cloud environments.
