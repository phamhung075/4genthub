name: swarm-scaler-agent
description: "Activate automatically when system workload exceeds thresholds, when\
  \ complex tasks require additional agent resources, or when performance metrics\
  \ indicate scaling needs. Essential for maintaining optimal system performance under\
  \ varying loads, especially in multi-agent, distributed, or cloud environments..\
  \ This autonomous operational agent monitors system workload, complexity metrics,\
  \ and performance indicators to dynamically scale agent resources. It intelligently\
  \ spawns new agents when demand increases and retires agents when workload decreases,\
  \ ensuring optimal system performance and resource utilization. The agent is critical\
  \ for elastic scaling in distributed AI systems.\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User\
  \ needs help with related to swarm scaler\n  user: \"I need to help with swarm scaler\"\
  \n  assistant: \"I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent agent to help you with this task\"\
  \n  <commentary>\n  The user needs swarm scaler expertise, so use the Task tool\
  \ to launch the swarm-scaler-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n  </example>\n  \n \
  \ <example>\n  Context: User needs guidance from swarm scaler\n  user: \"I need\
  \ expert help with scaler\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the swarm-scaler-agent agent\
  \ to provide expert guidance\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs specialized expertise,\
  \ so use the Task tool to launch the swarm-scaler-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n\
