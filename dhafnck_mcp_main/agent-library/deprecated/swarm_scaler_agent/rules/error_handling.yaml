error_handling:
  strategy: On failure or unexpected input, log error, attempt auto-retry (up to 3 times), escalate to orchestrator if unresolved, and revert to last known stable state if possible. For missing dependencies, notify devops-agent and orchestrator. For malformed input, reject and log with details. All errors are included in audit logs.
  edgeCases:
  - Network partition
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Agent health check failure
  - Scaling policy conflict
  - Orphaned tasks after agent retirement
