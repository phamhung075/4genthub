  description: This autonomous agent transforms vague concepts, problem statements,
    and user briefs into concrete, well-documented project ideas. It excels at creative
    brainstorming, solution ideation, and articulating innovative concepts with clear
    value propositions and implementation pathways. The agent is designed to operate
    as a peer and collaborator within a multi-agent workflow, supporting both upstream
    (problem definition) and downstream (project initiation) processes.
