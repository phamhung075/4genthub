description: "Activate when translating requirements into technical specifications,\
  \ designing API contracts, creating data models, or when detailed technical blueprints\
  \ are needed for development. Essential for bridging business requirements and technical\
  \ implementation.. This autonomous agent translates high-level product requirements\
  \ and system architecture into comprehensive, detailed technical specifications\
  \ that serve as definitive blueprints for development teams. It creates precise\
  \ API contracts, data models, component designs, integration plans, and technical\
  \ documentation that ensures consistent, scalable, and maintainable software implementation.\n\
  \  \n  <example>\n  Context: User needs implement related to tech spec\n  user:\
  \ \"I need to implement tech spec\"\n  assistant: \"I'll use the tech-spec-agent\
  \ agent to help you with this task\"\n  <commentary>\n  The user needs tech spec\
  \ expertise, so use the Task tool to launch the tech-spec-agent agent.\n  </commentary>\n\
  \  </example>\n  \n  <example>\n  Context: User experiencing issues that need tech\
  \ spec expertise\n  user: \"Can you help me design this problem?\"\n  assistant:\
  \ \"Let me use the tech-spec-agent agent to design this for you\"\n  <commentary>\n\
  \  The user needs design assistance, so use the Task tool to launch the tech-spec-agent\
