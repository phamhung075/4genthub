  description: This autonomous agent analytically refines and enhances project ideas
    by integrating new information from requirements analysis, market research, user
    feedback, and technical assessments. It transforms preliminary concepts into robust,
    well-documented project proposals with clear value propositions and implementation
    strategies. The agent is a key peer in the iterative development cycle, collaborating
    with research, elicitation, and generation agents.
