üìã LOGGING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - Unified Frontend and Backend Log Collection

‚≠ê WHAT IT DOES: Manages centralized logging for both frontend and backend systems. Provides unified log collection, storage, and status monitoring for comprehensive application observability.
üìã WHEN TO USE: Log collection, debugging, monitoring, and system observability.
üéØ CRITICAL FOR: Debugging applications, monitoring system health, and maintaining comprehensive audit trails.
üöÄ ENHANCED FEATURES: Batch log processing, unique batch IDs for traceability, automatic file management, and comprehensive status monitoring.

ü§ñ AI USAGE GUIDELINES:
‚Ä¢ USE receive_frontend_logs for collecting browser/frontend application logs
‚Ä¢ USE get_log_status to monitor logging system health and file sizes
‚Ä¢ BATCH logs when possible for better performance and traceability
‚Ä¢ MONITOR log file sizes to prevent disk space issues

| Action                | Required Parameters | Optional Parameters | Description                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| receive_frontend_logs | logs              | loggerId          | Receive and save frontend logs to file system |
| get_log_status        | (none)            |                   | Get logging system status and metrics         |

üìù PRACTICAL EXAMPLES FOR AI:
1. Collecting frontend errors:
   - action: "receive_frontend_logs", logs: [{"level": "ERROR", "message": "API call failed", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"}]

2. Monitoring log system:
   - action: "get_log_status" - returns file paths, sizes, and availability

üí° PARAMETERS:
‚Ä¢ logs: Array of log entries with level, message, timestamp, and optional data
‚Ä¢ loggerId: Optional identifier for log source (e.g., 'react-app', 'vue-component')

üîÑ AUTOMATIC FEATURES:
‚Ä¢ Batch ID generation for log traceability
‚Ä¢ Automatic log file creation and management
‚Ä¢ Structured log formatting with timestamps
‚Ä¢ File size monitoring and status reporting
‚Ä¢ UTF-8 encoding support for international content

üìä RESPONSE ENHANCEMENTS:
‚Ä¢ batch_id: Unique identifier for each log batch
‚Ä¢ log_file: Path to the log file where entries were saved
‚Ä¢ status: Comprehensive logging system metrics
‚Ä¢ file sizes and availability information

üí° BEST PRACTICES FOR AI:
‚Ä¢ Batch multiple log entries in single calls for better performance
‚Ä¢ Include meaningful loggerId for log source identification
‚Ä¢ Monitor log file sizes regularly with get_log_status
‚Ä¢ Use structured data in log entries for better analysis
‚Ä¢ Include timestamps in frontend logs for accurate sequencing

üõë ERROR HANDLING:
‚Ä¢ Invalid log entries are gracefully handled with fallback formatting
‚Ä¢ File system errors are caught and reported with clear error messages
‚Ä¢ JSON serialization errors are handled with string fallback
‚Ä¢ Missing log directories are automatically created
