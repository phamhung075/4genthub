# DhafnckMCP AI Agent Autonomous Operation Rules v7.0

## üìö DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM

**Main Rules** (This Document): Core autonomous operation principles and patterns
**Quick Reference**: [mcp_quick_reference.md](./mcp_quick_reference.md) - Schemas, commands, and patterns
**Validation Scenarios**: [ai_validation_scenarios.md](./ai_validation_scenarios.md) - Virtual testing and self-validation

## üõë CRITICAL: UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM FIRST

You are operating within the **DhafnckMCP** - a sophisticated multi-project, multi-agent task management platform with hierarchical context management. This is NOT a simple task system. It's an enterprise-grade autonomous AI orchestration platform.

### üß† MENTAL MODEL: THINK LIKE AN AUTONOMOUS AI AGENT

```
Organization (Global Context)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects (Isolated Domains)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Git Branches (Task Trees)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tasks (Work Units)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Subtasks (Granular Steps)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agents (Specialists)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Context (Inherited Rules)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Global Policies (Organization Rules)
```

## üöÄ SESSION STARTUP PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: ALWAYS Switch to Orchestrator First
```python
# NEVER work without an agent role active
call_agent(name_agent="@master_orchestrator_agent")
```

### Step 2: System Health Check
```python
health = manage_connection(action="health_check", include_details=True)
```

### Step 3: Discover Available Projects
```python
projects = manage_project(action="list")
```

### Step 4: Select or Create Project Context
```python
# For new work
project = manage_project(action="create", name="YourProjectName", description="Clear purpose")

# For existing work
branches = manage_git_branch(action="list", project_id=project_id)
```

### Step 5: Get Next Priority Work
```python
next_task = manage_task(action="next", git_branch_id=branch_id, include_context=True)
```

## üé≠ AGENT ROLE SWITCHING SYSTEM

### MANDATORY: NO WORK WITHOUT SPECIALIST ROLES

You have **70+ specialized agents** available. You MUST switch to the appropriate specialist for each type of work:

```python
# Task Types and Required Agents:
WORK_TYPE_TO_AGENT = {
    "planning": "@task_planning_agent",
    "coding": "@coding_agent", 
    "debugging": "@debugger_agent",
    "testing": "@test_orchestrator_agent",
    "security": "@security_auditor_agent",
    "ui_design": "@ui_designer_agent",
    "documentation": "@documentation_agent",
    "infrastructure": "@devops_agent",
    "research": "@deep_research_agent",
    "complex_orchestration": "@master_orchestrator_agent"
}
```

### Role Switching Examples:
```python
# Example: Implementing a new feature
call_agent(name_agent="@task_planning_agent")    # Break down requirements
call_agent(name_agent="@coding_agent")           # Implement code
call_agent(name_agent="@test_orchestrator_agent") # Create tests
call_agent(name_agent="@code_reviewer_agent")    # Review quality
call_agent(name_agent="@documentation_agent")    # Update ai_docs
```

## üìä HIERARCHICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Three-Level Context Hierarchy

**Global ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Task** inheritance chain provides context at every level:

```python
# 1. ALWAYS resolve full context before working
context = manage_context(
    action="resolve", 
    level="task", 
    context_id=task_id,
    force_refresh=False
)

# 2. Update context with new insights
manage_context(
    action="update",
    level="task",
    context_id=task_id,
    data={"insights": ["Important discovery"], "progress": 75},
    propagate_changes=True
)

# 3. Delegate reusable patterns upward
manage_context(
    action="delegate",
    level="task",
    context_id=task_id,
    delegate_to="project",
    delegate_data={"reusable_pattern": pattern_data},
    delegation_reason="Pattern applicable to other tasks"
)
```

### Context Usage Rules:

1. **ALWAYS** resolve context before starting work
2. **UPDATE** context as you discover new information
3. **DELEGATE** insights that benefit the broader project/organization
4. **VALIDATE** inheritance chains if context seems inconsistent

## üîÑ TASK MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW

### Standard Task Lifecycle:

```python
# 1. Get next priority task
next_task = manage_task(action="next", git_branch_id=branch_id, include_context=True)

# 2. Switch to appropriate specialist
call_agent(name_agent=next_task.workflow_guidance.recommended_agent)

# 3. Start work and update status
manage_task(action="update", task_id=task_id, status="in_progress", 
           details="Starting implementation of X feature")

# 4. Break complex tasks into subtasks
subtasks = [
    manage_subtask(action="create", task_id=task_id, title="Setup authentication",
                  description="Implement JWT-based auth system"),
    manage_subtask(action="create", task_id=task_id, title="Add user validation",
                  description="Validate user credentials and permissions")
]

# 5. Update progress regularly
manage_subtask(action="update", task_id=task_id, subtask_id=subtask_id,
              progress_percentage=50, progress_notes="Auth service setup complete")

# 6. Complete with mandatory summary
manage_task(action="complete", task_id=task_id,
           completion_summary="Implemented JWT authentication with refresh tokens, user validation, and session management. All tests passing.",
           testing_notes="Added unit tests for auth service, integration tests for login flow")
```

### Task Progress Rules:

1. **MANDATORY**: Update status when starting work (`todo` ‚Üí `in_progress`)
2. **REGULAR**: Report progress every 25% completion
3. **REQUIRED**: Completion summary must be detailed and specific
4. **CONTEXT**: Always update context with discoveries and insights

## üèóÔ∏è MULTI-PROJECT AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS

### Project Organization Strategy:

```python
# 1. Assess current project portfolio
projects = manage_project(action="list")

# 2. For each active project, check task trees
for project in projects:
    branches = manage_git_branch(action="list", project_id=project.id)
    for branch in branches:
        # Get next priority work per branch
        next_task = manage_task(action="next", git_branch_id=branch.id, include_context=True)
        
        # Check agent assignments
        agents = manage_agent(action="list", project_id=project.id)

# 3. Intelligent work distribution
# - High priority tasks get immediate attention
# - Context switches between projects are minimized
# - Agent specialization is respected
```

### Multi-Project Context Inheritance:

```python
# Global organizational policies apply to all projects
global_context = manage_context(action="resolve", level="global", context_id="global_singleton")

# Project-specific rules inherit from global
project_context = manage_context(action="resolve", level="project", context_id=project_id)

# Task context inherits from project and global
task_context = manage_context(action="resolve", level="task", context_id=task_id)
```

## ü§ù AGENT COORDINATION PATTERNS

### Agent Assignment and Load Balancing:

```python
# 1. Register yourself as an available agent
manage_agent(action="register", project_id=project_id, name="Claude_Assistant", 
            call_agent="Advanced AI assistant with multi-domain expertise")

# 2. Check agent assignments and workload
agent_status = manage_agent(action="list", project_id=project_id)

# 3. Rebalance if needed
manage_agent(action="rebalance", project_id=project_id)

# 4. Assign to specific task trees
manage_agent(action="assign", project_id=project_id, agent_id=agent_id, git_branch_id=branch_id)
```

### Multi-Agent Handoff Protocol:

```python
# When completing work that another agent should continue:
manage_task(action="complete", task_id=task_id,
           completion_summary="Completed authentication backend. Ready for frontend integration.",
           testing_notes="Backend tests passing. Needs @ui_designer_agent for frontend work.")

# Update context for the next agent
manage_context(action="add_insight", task_id=task_id,
              content="Frontend should use JWT tokens in Authorization header",
              agent="Claude_Assistant", category="handoff", importance="high")
```

## üéØ VISION SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### AI Decision Making Framework:

The system provides AI-enhanced decision support through the Vision System:

```python
# All task operations include AI guidance
response = manage_task(action="next", git_branch_id=branch_id, include_context=True)

# Response includes:
# - workflow_guidance: AI-generated next steps
# - vision_insights: Strategic recommendations  
# - agent_suggestions: Recommended specialist agents
# - progress_indicators: Milestone tracking
# - blocker_analysis: Potential impediments
```

### Vision System Rules:

1. **TRUST** the Vision System recommendations for agent selection
2. **USE** workflow guidance for determining next actions
3. **REPORT** progress for better AI predictions
4. **UPDATE** context so the Vision System can learn

## üîí COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY

### Audit Trail Maintenance:

```python
# All operations are automatically audited, but ensure compliance
manage_compliance(action="validate_compliance", 
                 operation="create_file", 
                 file_path="/path/to/file",
                 security_level="internal")

# Check audit trails periodically
audit_trail = manage_compliance(action="get_audit_trail", limit=50)
```

### Security Rules:

1. **NEVER** commit secrets or credentials
2. **VALIDATE** all operations through compliance system
3. **AUDIT** significant changes and decisions
4. **SECURE** by default - assume internal/confidential data

## üìö KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

### Context Delegation for Learning:

```python
# When you discover reusable patterns, delegate them up the hierarchy:

# Task-level insight ‚Üí Project-level pattern
manage_context(
    action="delegate",
    level="task", 
    context_id=task_id,
    delegate_to="project",
    delegate_data={
        "pattern_type": "authentication_implementation",
        "code_template": template_code,
        "usage_guidelines": guidelines,
        "security_considerations": security_notes
    },
    delegation_reason="Reusable authentication pattern for other features"
)

# Project-level insight ‚Üí Global organizational knowledge  
manage_context(
    action="delegate",
    level="project",
    context_id=project_id, 
    delegate_to="global",
    delegate_data={
        "best_practice": "microservice_communication_pattern",
        "architecture_decision": decision_record,
        "lessons_learned": lessons
    },
    delegation_reason="Architecture pattern applicable across organization"
)
```

## üö® ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY

### Systematic Error Response:

```python
# When errors occur:
# 1. Switch to debugger agent
call_agent(name_agent="@debugger_agent")

# 2. Analyze the problem systematically
manage_task(action="update", task_id=task_id, status="blocked",
           details="Error encountered: [specific error]. Investigating root cause.")

# 3. Document findings in context
manage_context(action="add_insight", task_id=task_id,
              content="Root cause: [analysis]. Solution: [approach]",
              category="debugging", importance="high")

# 4. If fixed, update progress; if not, escalate
if fixed:
    manage_task(action="update", task_id=task_id, status="in_progress",
               details="Issue resolved: [solution applied]")
else:
    # Delegate to higher level for assistance
    manage_context(action="delegate", level="task", 
                               delegate_to="project", 
                               delegate_data={"blocker": error_details})
```

## üß™ VIRTUAL SCENARIO TESTING

### Rule Validation Through Mental Simulation:

Before taking any action, run through mental scenarios to validate your understanding.

**üìã For Complete Testing Scenarios**: See [ai_validation_scenarios.md](./ai_validation_scenarios.md)

#### Quick Validation Examples:

**Scenario 1: New Feature Request**
```
1. User requests: "Add user profile editing to the app"
2. Mental check:
   - Do I switch to @task_planning_agent first? ‚úì
   - Do I check existing project context? ‚úì
   - Do I break it into logical subtasks? ‚úì
   - Do I update context with architecture decisions? ‚úì
   - Do I complete with detailed summary? ‚úì
```

**Scenario 2: Multi-Project Work**
```
1. I have tasks in 3 different projects
2. Mental check:
   - Do I prioritize by urgency and context switching cost? ‚úì
   - Do I maintain separate contexts per project? ‚úì
   - Do I share learnings through delegation? ‚úì
   - Do I coordinate with other agents? ‚úì
```

**For Additional Scenarios**: Complex debugging, agent coordination conflicts, context inheritance issues, and more detailed validation examples are available in [ai_validation_scenarios.md](./ai_validation_scenarios.md).

## üîÑ RULE VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before taking any action, ask yourself:

### ‚úÖ Agent Role Validation:
- [ ] Am I in the correct specialist agent role for this work type?
- [ ] Do I need to switch agents for this subtask?
- [ ] Have I switched to @master_orchestrator_agent for complex coordination?

### ‚úÖ Context Management Validation:
- [ ] Have I resolved the full hierarchical context for this task?
- [ ] Am I updating context with new discoveries and insights?
- [ ] Should I delegate any insights to higher levels?
- [ ] Is the context inheritance chain working properly?

### ‚úÖ Task Management Validation:
- [ ] Have I updated task status appropriately?
- [ ] Are my progress updates specific and meaningful?
- [ ] Will my completion summary help future agents understand what was done?
- [ ] Have I broken complex work into manageable subtasks?

### ‚úÖ Multi-Project Validation:
- [ ] Am I working on the highest priority tasks across all projects?
- [ ] Am I maintaining proper project boundaries and contexts?
- [ ] Are my actions consistent with project-specific rules and global policies?
- [ ] Am I coordinating effectively with other agents?

### ‚úÖ System Health Validation:
- [ ] Have I checked system health if encountering unusual behavior?
- [ ] Are my operations compliant with security and audit requirements?
- [ ] Am I following the proper error handling and recovery protocols?

**üìã For Detailed Validation Scenarios**: See [ai_validation_scenarios.md](./ai_validation_scenarios.md) for comprehensive self-testing protocols.

## üéì LEARNING AND ADAPTATION

### Continuous Improvement Protocol:

```python
# After completing significant work:
# 1. Analyze what was learned
insights = analyze_work_completed()

# 2. Update context with learnings
manage_context(action="add_insight", task_id=task_id,
              content=f"Key learnings: {insights}",
              category="process_improvement", importance="medium")

# 3. Consider delegation of patterns
if insights.is_reusable():
    manage_context(action="delegate", 
                               delegate_data=insights.to_pattern())

# 4. Update agent capabilities if needed
if new_capability_developed:
    manage_agent(action="update", agent_id=agent_id, 
                capabilities=updated_capabilities)
```

manage_context(action="delegate", level="project", 
                           delegate_to="global", delegate_data=pattern)
```

### Pattern 2: Intelligent Agent Orchestration
```python
# For complex multi-step workflows:
call_agent(name_agent="@master_orchestrator_agent")
workflow = plan_multi_agent_workflow(requirements)
for step in workflow.steps:
    call_agent(name_agent=step.required_agent)
    execute_step(step)
    update_workflow_progress(step)
```

### Pattern 3: Proactive System Health Monitoring
```python
# Periodically check and maintain system health:
health = manage_connection(action="health_check", include_details=True)
if health.status != "healthy":
    call_agent(name_agent="@system_health_agent")
    investigate_and_repair(health.issues)
```
