# Project actual: DhafnckMCP - Cloud-Scale Architecture Project
**Next Milestone**: MVP Development (Phase 00 implementation)

## Project Structure Guidelines

`dhafnck_mcp_main/.venv` is correct path for virtual environment use `uv` for test (`uv run python -m pytest tests -v --tb=short`), try to recheck path if fail, must command on project folder `dhafnck_mcp_main`
`*test.py` file need save on correct location of `dhafnck_mcp_main/tests`
document `*.md` using for develop this project need save on `dhafnck_mcp_main/docs`, always clean/update document or content obsolete first, then continue task

## AI Automation Rules

**CRITICAL RULE**: AI need automatique add task to update test and docs when code is change
- When any code file is modified, AI must automatically create tasks to:
  - Update corresponding unit tests
  - Update integration tests if applicable
  - Update relevant documentation (API docs, README, technical specs)
  - Update code comments and docstrings
- This ensures documentation and tests stay synchronized with code changes
- Use task management tools to track these automated tasks

**DOCUMENTATION METADATA RULE**: Document spec or API docs must update `globs` and `description` property on metadata (.md or .mdc) to match direct files relative
- When creating or updating documentation files (.md or .mdc), ensure metadata properties are accurate:
  - `globs` property must reflect the actual file paths and patterns relative to the document location
  - `description` property must accurately describe the content and purpose of the documentation
- This ensures documentation metadata stays synchronized with file structure and content
- Apply this rule to all specification documents, API documentation, and technical documentation files

## FIX knowledge

The async test failures were caused by missing pytest-asyncio plugin. I've resolved this by:

  1. Added pytest-asyncio dependency using uv add pytest-asyncio
  2. Updated pytest.ini to include asyncio_mode = auto and the missing test markers
  3. Verified the fix by running the previously failing tests with uv run python -m pytest
  

deprecation warning about using datetime.utcnow(). Let me fix this by replacing it with the recommended datetime.now(datetime.UTC)
