## Key Metrics - Dramatic Improvement ⬆️

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Agents with placeholders** | 67/68 (98.5%) | 54/68 (79.4%) | **-19.1%** |

## Common Issues Found

1. **Config Description Placeholders**: Template text in agent descriptions
2. **Instruction Template Text**: Bracket placeholders like "[Description here]" in instruction files
3. **Generic Examples**: Non-specific examples that don't demonstrate real functionality
4. **Incomplete Capability Lists**: Generic capability descriptions instead of specific technical abilities

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete High-Priority Agents (In Progress)
Focus on the 7 critical agents that form the core of the system:
1. coding_agent - Core development functionality
2. test_orchestrator_agent - Testing and QA orchestration
3. debugger_agent - Problem diagnosis and resolution
4. system_architect_agent - System design and architecture
5. security_auditor_agent - Security analysis and auditing
6. devops_agent - DevOps and infrastructure management
7. deep_research_agent - Research and analysis capabilities

### Phase 2: Agent Library Cleanup
Remove 26 redundant agents identified in cleanup recommendations:
- Merge duplicate testing agents into test_orchestrator_agent
- Consolidate UI design agents into ui_designer_expert_shadcn_agent
- Remove broken or minimal-value agents

### Phase 3: Complete Remaining Core Agents
Focus on the remaining 43 core agents that should be kept in the final library.

## Template Quality Standards

All agents must meet these standards to be considered complete:

- ✅ No placeholder text (brackets, TODOs, etc.)
- ✅ Comprehensive descriptions (100-150 words)
- ✅ 8-12 specific technical capabilities
- ✅ 8-10 step operational processes
- ✅ Real input/output examples
- ✅ Edge case handling strategies
- ✅ Integration patterns with related agents
- ✅ Measurable quality standards

## Progress Tracking

This report will be updated as agents are completed. Target completion: 43 production-ready core agents by end of cleanup initiative.
