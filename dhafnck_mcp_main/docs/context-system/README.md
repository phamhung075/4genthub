# Context System Documentation

## Overview

The DhafnckMCP Context System is a hierarchical, cloud-synchronized notebook system where AI agents manually write and read context information. Think of it as a shared cloud notebook that AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor) must remember to check before work and update after work. The system cannot modify the AI's built-in tools or automatically capture their actions.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic AI Workflow
```python
# 1. AI checks the notebook before starting
context = manage_context(
    action="get",
    level="task",
    context_id="task-123",
    include_inherited=True
)
previous_work = context.get("data", {}).get("progress", [])

# 2. AI does work with its built-in tools
# ... (Read files, Edit files, Run tests) ...

# 3. AI manually updates the notebook after work
manage_context(
    action="update",
    level="task",
    context_id="task-123",
    data={
        "progress": ["Implemented feature X"],
        "files_modified": ["src/feature.py"],
        "discoveries": ["Found existing utility"],
        "next_steps": ["Add tests"]
    }
)
```

## üîë Key Features

### Cloud Notebook Sync
- Manual writes to notebook sync to cloud automatically
- Local journal for offline work  
- Background retry with exponential backoff
- Zero data loss for notebook entries

### 4-Tier Hierarchy
```
GLOBAL ‚Üí PROJECT ‚Üí BRANCH ‚Üí TASK
```
- Automatic inheritance from parent levels
- Pattern delegation to higher levels
- Flexible context resolution

### Multi-Agent Awareness
- Notebook changes notify other agents
- All agents see same notebook (eventually)
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
- Each agent must manually check notebook

### Manual Context Management
- AI must remember to check notebook before work
- AI must manually write updates after work
- Templates help remind AI what to track
- Patterns make updates easier

## üìä Success Metrics

| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| Manual Context Updates | Depends on AI discipline |
| Data Loss Rate | 0% (for manual updates) |
| Sync Success Rate | 99.9% (when AI updates) |
| Multi-Agent Conflicts | <1/day |
| Sync Overhead | <5ms |

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Network connectivity for cloud sync
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
